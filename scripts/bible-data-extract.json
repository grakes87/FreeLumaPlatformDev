He forgave us all our sins, | having canceled the written code, with its regulations, that was against us and that stood opposed to us; he took it away, nailing it to the cross. | And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross. | Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day. | These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ. | Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you for the prize. Such a person goes into great detail about what he has seen, and his unspiritual mind puffs him up with idle notions. | He has lost connection with the Head, from whom the whole body, supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows as God causes it to grow. | Since you died with Christ to the basic principles of this world, why, as though you still belonged to it, do you submit to its rules: | \"Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!\"? | These are all destined to perish with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings. | Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.",

      "ChapterText": "Quiero que sepan cuánto me preocupo por ustedes, por los de Laodicea y por todos los que nunca me han visto en persona; mi deseo es que sus corazones sean consolados, estando unidos en amor, y que alcancen todas las riquezas de la plena seguridad que da el entendimiento, para que conozcan el misterio de Dios, es decir, de Cristo, en quien están escondidos todos los tesoros de la sabiduría y del conocimiento. Les digo esto para que nadie los engañe con palabras persuasivas. Porque aunque no estoy físicamente con ustedes, sí lo estoy en espíritu, y me alegro al ver el buen orden que tienen y la firmeza de su fe en Cristo.\n\nAsí que, de la misma manera que recibieron a Cristo Jesús como Señor, vivan ahora en él: arraigados y edificados en él, firmes en la fe como se les enseñó, y rebosando de gratitud. Tengan cuidado de que nadie los engañe por medio de filosofías y huecas sutilezas, que se basan en tradiciones humanas y en los principios de este mundo, y no en Cristo. Porque en él habita corporalmente toda la plenitud de la divinidad, y ustedes están completos en él, que es la cabeza de todo principado y autoridad.\n\nEn él también fueron circuncidados, no con una circuncisión hecha por manos humanas, sino con la circuncisión que consiste en despojarse del cuerpo pecaminoso, es decir, la circuncisión que viene de Cristo. Ustedes fueron sepultados con él en el bautismo, y en él también resucitaron por la fe en el poder de Dios, que lo resucitó de entre los muertos. Antes, ustedes estaban muertos en sus pecados y en la incircuncisión de su carne, pero Dios les dio vida junto con Cristo, perdonándoles todos los pecados. Canceló la deuda que teníamos por los mandamientos y la eliminó clavándola en la cruz. Despojó a los poderes y autoridades, y los exhibió públicamente, triunfando sobre ellos en la cruz.\n\nPor eso, que nadie los juzgue por lo que comen o beben, o respecto a días de fiesta, luna nueva o días de reposo. Todo eso es solo una sombra de lo que ha de venir; la realidad es Cristo. Que nadie los prive de su premio, con falsas humildades y adoración de ángeles, metiéndose en cosas que no ha visto, hinchado sin motivo por su mente carnal. No se mantienen unidos a la cabeza, de la cual todo el cuerpo, sostenido y unido por las articulaciones y ligamentos, crece como Dios quiere.\n\nAsí que, si ustedes han muerto con Cristo a los principios de este mundo, ¿por qué, como si todavía pertenecieran al mundo, se someten a reglas como: “No toques esto”, “No pruebes aquello”, “No manejes lo otro”? Todas esas cosas están destinadas a desaparecer con el uso, porque son mandamientos y enseñanzas humanas. Tienen apariencia de sabiduría, con su religiosidad, falsa humildad y duro trato del cuerpo, pero no tienen valor alguno contra los deseos de la carne.",

      "ChapterText": "And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years. | And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds. | And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them; | And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass. | For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it. | And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD. | And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD because of the Midianites, | That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage; | And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you their land; | And I said unto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice. | And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites. | And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valor. | And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites. | And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee? | And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house. | And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man. | And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then show me a sign that thou talkest with me. | Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again. | And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it. | And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so. | Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight. | And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face. | And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die. | Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. | And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it: | And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down. | Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night. | And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built. | And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing. | Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it. | And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar. | Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar. | Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel. | But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him. | And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them. | And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said, | Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said. | And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water. | And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew. | And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.",

      "ChapterText": "Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD, and for seven years he gave them into the hands of the Midianites. | Because the power of Midian was so oppressive, the Israelites prepared shelters for themselves in mountain clefts, caves and strongholds. | Whenever the Israelites planted their crops, the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples invaded the country. | They camped on the land and ruined the crops all the way to Gaza and did not spare a living thing for Israel, neither sheep nor cattle nor donkeys. | They came up with their livestock and their tents like swarms of locusts. It was impossible to count the men and their camels; they invaded the land to ravage it. | Midian so impoverished the Israelites that they cried out to the LORD for help. | When the Israelites cried to the LORD because of Midian, | he sent them a prophet, who said, \"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I brought you up out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. | I snatched you from the power of Egypt and from the hand of all your oppressors. I drove them from before you and gave you their land. | I said to you, 'I am the LORD your God; do not worship the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you live.' But you have not listened to me.\" | The angel of the LORD came and sat down under the oak in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to keep it from the Midianites. | When the angel of the LORD appeared to Gideon, he said, \"The LORD is with you, mighty warrior.\" | \"But sir,\" Gideon replied, \"if the LORD is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonders that our fathers told us about when they said, 'Did not the LORD bring us up out of Egypt?' But now the LORD has abandoned us and put us into the hand of Midian.\" | The LORD turned to him and said, \"Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian's hand. Am I not sending you?\" | \"But Lord, \"Gideon asked, \"how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family.\" | The LORD answered, \"I will be with you, and you will strike down all the Midianites together.\" | Gideon replied, \"If now I have found favor in your eyes, give me a sign that it is really you talking to me. | Please do not go away until I come back and bring my offering and set it before you.\" And the LORD said, \"I will wait until you return.\" | Gideon went in, prepared a young goat, and from an ephah of flour he made bread without yeast. Putting the meat in a basket and its broth in a pot, he brought them out and offered them to him under the oak. | The angel of God said to him, \"Take the meat and the unleavened bread, place them on this rock, and pour out the broth.\" And Gideon did so. | With the tip of the staff that was in his hand, the angel of the LORD touched the meat and the unleavened bread. Fire flared from the rock, consuming the meat and the bread. And the angel of the LORD disappeared. | When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the LORD, he exclaimed, \"Ah, Sovereign LORD! I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face!\" | But the LORD said to him, \"Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die.\" | So Gideon built an altar to the LORD there and called it The LORD is Peace. To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. | That same night the LORD said to him, \"Take the second bull from your father's herd, the one seven years old. Tear down your father's altar to Baal and cut down the Asherah pole beside it. | Then build a proper kind of altar to the LORD your God on the top of this height. Using the wood of the Asherah pole that you cut down, offer the second bull as a burnt offering.\" | So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the LORD told him. But because he was afraid of his family and the men of the town, he did it at night rather than in the daytime. | In the morning when the men of the town got up, there was Baal's altar, demolished, with the Asherah pole beside it cut down and the second bull sacrificed on the newly built altar! | They asked each other, \"Who did this?\" When they carefully investigated, they were told, \"Gideon son of Joash did it.\" | The men of the town demanded of Joash, \"Bring out your son. He must die, because he has broken down Baal's altar and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.\" | But Joash replied to the hostile crowd around him, \"Are you going to plead Baal's cause? Are you trying to save him? Whoever fights for him shall be put to death by morning! If Baal really is a god, he can defend himself when someone breaks down his altar.\" | So that day they called Gideon \"Jerub-Baal, \"saying, \"Let Baal contend with him,\" because he broke down Baal's altar. | Now all the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples joined forces and crossed over the Jordan and camped in the Valley of Jezreel. | Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet, summoning the Abiezrites to follow him. | He sent messengers throughout Manasseh, calling them to arms, and also into Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali, so that they too went up to meet them. | Gideon said to God, \"If you will save Israel by my hand as you have promised- | look, I will place a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry, then I will know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you said.\" | And that is what happened. Gideon rose early the next day; he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew-a bowlful of water. | Then Gideon said to God, \"Do not be angry with me. Let me make just one more request. Allow me one more test with the fleece. This time make the fleece dry and the ground covered with dew.\" | That night God did so. Only the fleece was dry; all the ground was covered with dew.",

      "ChapterText": "The people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD gave them into the hand of Midian seven years. | And the hand of Midian overpowered Israel, and because of Midian the people of Israel made for themselves the dens that are in the mountains and the caves and the strongholds. | For whenever the Israelites planted crops, the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East would come up against them. | They would encamp against them and devour the produce of the land, as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance in Israel and no sheep or ox or donkey. | For they would come up with their livestock and their tents; they would come like locusts in number- both they and their camels could not be counted- so that they laid waste the land as they came in. | And Israel was brought very low because of Midian. And the people of Israel cried out for help to the LORD. | When the people of Israel cried out to the LORD on account of the Midianites, | the LORD sent a prophet to the people of Israel. And he said to them, \"Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I led you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of bondage. | And I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out before you and gave you their land. | And I said to you, 'I am the LORD your God; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell.' But you have not obeyed my voice.\" | Now the angel of the LORD came and sat under the terebinth at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress to hide it from the Midianites. | And the angel of the LORD appeared to him and said to him, \"The LORD is with you, O mighty man of valor.\" | And Gideon said to him, \"Please, sir, if the LORD is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all his wonderful deeds that our fathers recounted to us, saying, 'Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?' But now the LORD has forsaken us and given us into the hand of Midian.\" | And the LORD turned to him and said, \"Go in this might of yours and save Israel from the hand of Midian; do not I send you?\" | And he said to him, \"Please, Lord, how can I save Israel? Behold, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.\" | And the LORD said to him, \"But I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man.\" | And he said to him, \"If now I have found favor in your eyes, then show me a sign that it is you who speaks with me. | Please do not depart from here until I come to you and bring out my present and set it before you.\" And he said, \"I will stay till you return.\" | So Gideon went into his house and prepared a young goat and unleavened cakes from an ephah of flour. The meat he put in a basket, and the broth he put in a pot, and brought them to him under the terebinth and presented them. | And the angel of God said to him, \"Take the meat and the unleavened cakes, and put them on this rock, and pour the broth over them.\" And he did so. | Then the angel of the LORD reached out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes. And fire sprang up from the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. And the angel of the LORD vanished from his sight. | Then Gideon perceived that he was the angel of the LORD. And Gideon said, \"Alas, O Lord GOD! For now I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face.\" | But the LORD said to him, \"Peace be to you. Do not fear; you shall not die.\" | Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD and called it, The LORD is Peace. To this day it still stands at Ophrah, which belongs to the Abiezrites. | That night the LORD said to him, \"Take your father's bull, and the second bull seven years old, and pull down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the Asherah that is beside it | and build an altar to the LORD your God on the top of the stronghold here, with stones laid in due order. Then take the second bull and offer it as a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah that you shall cut down.\" | So Gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the LORD had told him. But because he was too afraid of his family and the men of the town to do it by day, he did it by night. | When the men of the town rose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah beside it was cut down, and the second bull was offered on the altar that had been built. | And they said to one another, \"Who has done this thing?\" And after they had searched and inquired, they said, \"Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.\" | Then the men of the town said to Joash, \"Bring out your son, that he may die, for he has broken down the altar of Baal and cut down the Asherah beside it.\" | But Joash said to all who stood against him, \"Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? Whoever contends for him shall be put to death by morning. If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because his altar has been broken down.\" | Therefore on that day Gideon was called Jerubbaal, that is to say, \"Let Baal contend against him,\" because he broke down his altar. | Now all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East came together, and they crossed the Jordan and encamped in the Valley of Jezreel. | But the Spirit of the LORD clothed Gideon, and he sounded the trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called out to follow him. | And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they too were called out to follow him. And he sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they went up to meet them. | Then Gideon said to God, \"If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said, | behold, I am laying a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece alone, and it is dry on all the ground, then I shall know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said.\" | And it was so. When he rose early next morning and squeezed the fleece, he wrung enough dew from the fleece to fill a bowl with water. | Then Gideon said to God, \"Let not your anger burn against me; let me speak just once more. Please let me test just once more with the fleece. Please let it be dry on the fleece only, and on all the ground let there be dew.\" | And God did so that night; and it was dry on the fleece only, and on all the ground there was dew.",

For fear of Midian the Israelites established the fire signals on the mountains, the caves for refuge, and the strongholds. | And it used to be that when the Israelites had completed their sowing, Midian, Amalek and the Kedemites would come up, | encamp opposite them, and destroy the produce of the land as far as the outskirts of Gaza, leaving no sustenance in Israel, nor sheep, oxen or asses. | For they would come up with their livestock, and their tents would become as numerous as locusts; and neither they nor their camels could be numbered, when they came into the land to lay it waste. | Thus was Israel reduced to misery by Midian, and so the Israelites cried out to the LORD. | When Israel cried out to the LORD because of Midian, | he sent a prophet to the Israelites who said to them, \"The LORD, the God of Israel, says: I led you up from Egypt; I brought you out of the place of slavery. | I rescued you from the power of Egypt and of all your other oppressors. I drove them out before you and gave you their land. | And I said to you: I, the LORD, am your God; you shall not venerate the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are dwelling. But you did not obey me.\" | Then the angel of the LORD came and sat under the terebinth in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite. While his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the wine press to save it from the Midianites, | the angel of the LORD appeared to him and said, \"The LORD is with you, O champion!\" | \"My Lord,\" Gideon said to him, \"if the LORD is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are his wondrous deeds of which our fathers told us when they said, 'Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?' For now the LORD has abandoned us and has delivered us into the power of Midian.\" | The LORD turned to him and said, \"Go with the strength you have and save Israel from the power of Midian. It is I who send you.\" | But he answered him, \"Please, my lord, how can I save Israel? My family is the meanest in Manasseh, and I am the most insignificant in my father's house.\" | \"I shall be with you,\" the LORD said to him, \"and you will cut down Midian to the last man.\" | He answered him, \"If I find favor with you, give me a sign that you are speaking with me. | Do not depart from here, I pray you, until I come back to you and bring out my offering and set it before you.\" He answered, \"I will await your return.\" | So Gideon went off and prepared a kid and an ephah of flour in the form of unleavened cakes. Putting the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, he brought them out to him under the terebinth and presented them. | The angel of God said to him, \"Take the meat and unleavened cakes and lay them on this rock; then pour out the broth.\" When he had done so, | the angel of the LORD stretched out the tip of the staff he held, and touched the meat and unleavened cakes. Thereupon a fire came up from the rock which consumed the meat and unleavened cakes, and the angel of the LORD disappeared from sight. | Gideon, now aware that it had been the angel of the LORD, said, \"Alas, Lord GOD, that I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face!\" | The LORD answered him, \"Be calm, do not fear. You shall not die.\" | So Gideon built there an altar to the LORD and called it Yahweh-shalom. To this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. | That same night the LORD said to him, \"Take the seven-year-old spare bullock and destroy your father's altar to Baal and cut down the sacred pole that is by it. | You shall build, instead, the proper kind of altar to the LORD, your God, on top of this stronghold. Then take the spare bullock and offer it as a holocaust on the wood from the sacred pole you have cut down.\" | So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the LORD had commanded him. But through fear of his family and of the townspeople, he would not do it by day, but did it at night. | Early the next morning the townspeople found that the altar of Baal had been destroyed, the sacred pole near it cut down, and the spare bullock offered on the altar that was built. | They asked one another, \"Who did this?\" Their inquiry led them to the conclusion that Gideon, son of Joash, had done it. | So the townspeople said to Joash, \"Bring out your son that he may die, for he has destroyed the altar of Baal and has cut down the sacred pole that was near it.\" | But Joash replied to all who were standing around him, \"Do you intend to act in Baal's stead, or be his champion? If anyone acts for him, he shall be put to death by morning. If he whose altar has been destroyed is a god, let him act for himself!\" | So on that day Gideon was called Jerubbaal, because of the words, \"Let Baal take action against him, since he destroyed his altar.\" | Then all Midian and Amalek and the Kedemites mustered and crossed over into the valley of Jezreel, where they encamped. | The spirit of the LORD enveloped Gideon; he blew the horn that summoned Abiezer to follow him. | He sent messengers, too, throughout Manasseh, which also obeyed his summons; through Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali, likewise, he sent messengers and these tribes advanced to meet the others. | Gideon said to God, \"If indeed you are going to save Israel through me, as you promised, | I am putting this woolen fleece on the threshing floor. If dew comes on the fleece alone, while all the ground is dry, I shall know that you will save Israel through me, as you promised.\" | That is what took place. Early the next morning he wrung the dew from the fleece, squeezing out of it a bowlful of water. | Gideon then said to God, \"Do not be angry with me if I speak once more. Let me make just one more test with the fleece. Let the fleece alone be dry, but let there be dew on all the ground.\" | That night God did so; the fleece alone was dry, but there was dew on all the ground.",

      "ChapterText": "Then the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord. So the Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian for seven years, and the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel. Because of the Midianites, the children of Israel made for themselves the dens, the caves, and the strongholds which are in the mountains. So it was, whenever Israel had sown, Midianites would come up; also Amalekites and the people of the East would come up against them. Then they would encamp against them and destroy the produce of the earth as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep nor ox nor donkey. For they would come up with their livestock and their tents, coming in as numerous as locusts; both they and their camels were without number; and they would enter the land to destroy it. So Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites, and the children of Israel cried out to the Lord. And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried out to the Lord because of the Midianites, that the Lord sent a prophet to the children of Israel, who said to them, Thus says the Lord God of Israel: I brought you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of bondage; and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out before you and gave you their land. Also I said to you, I am the Lord your God; do not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. But you have not obeyed My voice. Now the Angel of the Lord came and sat under the terebinth tree which was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon threshed wheat in the winepress, in order to hide it from the Midianites. And the Angel of the Lord appeared to him, and said to him, The Lord is with you, you mighty man of valor! Gideon said to Him, O my lord, if the Lord is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all His miracles which our fathers told us about, saying, Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt? But now the Lord has forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites. Then the Lord turned to him and said, Go in this might of yours, and you shall save Israel from the hand of the Midianites. Have I not sent you? So he said to Him, O my Lord, how can I save Israel? Indeed my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house. And the Lord said to him, Surely I will be with you, and you shall defeat the Midianites as one man. Then he said to Him, If now I have found favor in Your sight, then show me a sign that it is You who talk with me. Do not depart from here, I pray, until I come to You and bring out my offering and set it before You. And He said, I will wait until you come back. So Gideon went in and prepared a young goat, and unleavened bread from an ephah of flour. The meat he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot; and he brought them out to Him under the terebinth tree and presented them. The Angel of God said to him, Take the meat and the unleavened bread and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so. Then the Angel of the Lord put out the end of the staff that was in His hand, and touched the meat and the unleavened bread; and fire rose out of the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread. And the Angel of the Lord departed out of his sight. Now Gideon perceived that He was the Angel of the Lord. So Gideon said, Alas, O Lord God! For I have seen the Angel of the Lord face to face. Then the Lord said to him, Peace be with you; do not fear, you shall not die. So Gideon built an altar there to the Lord, and called it The-Lord-Is-Peace. To this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. Now it came to pass the same night that the Lord said to him, Take your father’s young bull, the second bull of seven years old, and tear down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the wooden image that is beside it; and build an altar to the Lord your God on top of this rock in the proper arrangement, and take the second bull and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the image which you shall cut down. So Gideon took ten men from among his servants and did as the Lord had said to him. But because he feared his father’s household and the men of the city too much to do it by day, he did it by night. And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, there was the altar of Baal, torn down; and the wooden image that was beside it was cut down, and the second bull was being offered on the altar which had been built. So they said to one another, Who has done this thing? And when they had inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing. Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out your son, that he may die, because he has torn down the altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the wooden image that was beside it. But Joash said to all who stood against him, Would you plead for Baal? Would you save him? Let the one who would plead for him be put to death by morning! If he is a god, let him plead for himself, because his altar has been torn down! Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he has torn down his altar. Then all the Midianites and Amalekites, the people of the East, gathered together; and they crossed over and encamped in the Valley of Jezreel. But the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon; then he blew the trumpet, and the Abiezrites gathered behind him. And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, who also gathered behind him. He also sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali; and they came up to meet them. So Gideon said to God, If You will save Israel by my hand as You have said— look, I shall put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor; if there is dew on the fleece only, and it is dry on all the ground, then I shall know that You will save Israel by my hand, as You have said. And it was so. When he rose early the next morning and squeezed the fleece together, he wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water. Then Gideon said to God, Do not be angry with me, but let me speak just once more: Let me test, I pray, just once more with the fleece; let it now be dry only on the fleece, but on all the ground let there be dew. And God did so that night. It was dry on the fleece only, but there was dew on all the ground.",

      "ChapterText": "The Israelites did evil in the Lord’s sight. So the Lord handed them over to the Midianites for seven years. The Midianites were so cruel that the Israelites made hiding places for themselves in the mountains, caves, and strongholds. Whenever the Israelites planted their crops, marauders from Midian, Amalek, and the people of the east would attack Israel, camping in the land and destroying crops as far away as Gaza. They left the Israelites with nothing to eat, taking all the sheep, goats, cattle, and donkeys. These enemy hordes, coming with their livestock and tents, were as thick as locusts. They arrived on droves of camels, too numerous to count, and they stayed until the land was stripped bare. So Israel was reduced to starvation by the Midianites. Then the Israelites cried out to the Lord for help. When they cried out to the Lord because of Midian, the Lord sent a prophet to the Israelites. He said, This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I brought you up out of slavery in Egypt. I rescued you from the Egyptians and from all who oppressed you. I drove out your enemies and gave you their land. I told you, I am the Lord your God. You must not worship the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you now live. But you have not listened to me. Then the angel of the Lord came and sat beneath the great tree at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash of the clan of Abiezer. Gideon son of Joash was threshing wheat at the bottom of a winepress to hide the grain from the Midianites. The angel of the Lord appeared to him and said, Mighty hero, the Lord is with you! Sir, Gideon replied, if the Lord is with us, why has all this happened to us? And where are all the miracles our ancestors told us about? Didn’t they say, The Lord brought us up out of Egypt? But now the Lord has abandoned us and handed us over to the Midianites. Then the Lord turned to him and said, Go with the strength you have, and rescue Israel from the Midianites. I am sending you! But Lord, Gideon replied, how can I rescue Israel? My clan is the weakest in the whole tribe of Manasseh, and I am the least in my entire family! The Lord said to him, I will be with you. And you will destroy the Midianites as if you were fighting against one man. Gideon replied, If you are truly going to help me, show me a sign to prove that it is really the Lord speaking to me. Don’t go away until I come back and bring my offering to you. He answered, I will stay here until you return. Gideon hurried home. He cooked a young goat, and with a basket of flour he baked some bread without yeast. Then, carrying the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, he brought them out and presented them to the angel, who was under the great tree. The angel of God said to him, Place the meat and the unleavened bread on this rock, and pour the broth over it. And Gideon did as he was told. Then the angel of the Lord touched the meat and bread with the tip of the staff in his hand, and fire flamed up from the rock and consumed all he had brought. And the angel of the Lord disappeared. When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the Lord, he cried out, Oh, Sovereign Lord, I’m doomed! I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face! It is all right, the Lord replied. Do not be afraid. You will not die. And Gideon built an altar to the Lord there and named it Yahweh-Shalom (which means the Lord is peace). The altar remains in Ophrah in the land of the clan of Abiezer to this day. That night the Lord said to Gideon, Take the second bull from your father’s herd, the one that is seven years old. Pull down your father’s altar to Baal, and cut down the Asherah pole standing beside it. Then build an altar to the Lord your God here on this hilltop sanctuary, laying the stones carefully. Sacrifice the bull as a burnt offering on the altar, using as fuel the wood of the Asherah pole you cut down. So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the Lord had commanded. But he did it at night because he was afraid of the other members of his father’s household and the people of the town. Early the next morning, as the people of the town began to stir, someone discovered that the altar of Baal had been broken down and that the Asherah pole beside it had been cut down. In their place a new altar had been built, and on it were the remains of the bull that had been sacrificed. The people said to each other, Who did this? And after asking around and making a careful search, they learned that it was Gideon, the son of Joash. Bring out your son, the men of the town demanded of Joash. He must die for destroying the altar of Baal and for cutting down the Asherah pole. But Joash shouted to the mob that confronted him, Why are you defending Baal? Will you argue his case? Whoever pleads his case will be put to death by morning! If Baal truly is a god, let him defend himself and destroy the one who broke down his altar! From then on Gideon was called Jerub-baal, which means Let Baal defend himself, because he broke down Baal’s altar. Soon afterward the armies of Midian, Amalek, and the people of the east formed an alliance against Israel and crossed the Jordan, camping in the Valley of Jezreel. Then the Spirit of the Lord took possession of Gideon. He blew a ram’s horn as a call to arms, and the men of the clan of Abiezer came to him. He also sent messengers throughout Manasseh, Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, summoning their warriors, and all of them responded. Then Gideon said to God, If you are truly going to use me to rescue Israel as you promised, prove it to me in this way. I will put a wool fleece on the threshing floor tonight. If the fleece is wet with dew in the morning but the ground is dry, then I will know that you are going to help me rescue Israel as you promised. And that is just what happened. When Gideon got up early the next morning, he squeezed the fleece and wrung out a whole bowlful of water. Then Gideon said to God, Please don’t be angry with me, but let me make one more request. Let me use the fleece for one more test. This time let the fleece remain dry while the ground around it is wet with dew. So that night God did as Gideon asked. The fleece was dry in the morning, but the ground was covered with dew.",

Look, my family is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the youngest in my father’s family. But I will be with you, the Lord said to him. You will strike Midian down as if it were one man. Then he said to him, If I have found favor with you, give me a sign that you are speaking with me. Please do not leave this place until I return to you. Let me bring my gift and set it before you. And he said, I will stay until you return. So Gideon went and prepared a young goat and unleavened bread from a half bushel of flour. He placed the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot. He brought them out and offered them to him under the oak. The angel of God said to him, Take the meat with the unleavened bread, put it on this stone, and pour the broth on it. So he did that. The angel of the Lord extended the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened bread. Fire came up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread. Then the angel of the Lord vanished from his sight. When Gideon realized that he was the angel of the Lord, he said, Oh no, Lord God! I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face! But the Lord said to him, Peace to you. Don’t be afraid, for you will not die. So Gideon built an altar to the Lord there and called it The Lord Is Peace. It is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites today. On that very night the Lord said to him, Take your father’s young bull and a second bull seven years old. Then tear down the altar of Baal that belongs to your father and cut down the Asherah pole beside it. Build a well-constructed altar to the Lord your God on the top of this mound. Take the second bull and offer it as a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah pole you cut down. So Gideon took ten of his male servants and did as the Lord had told him. But because he was too afraid of his father’s family and the men of the city to do it in the daytime, he did it at night. When the men of the city got up in the morning, they found Baal’s altar torn down, the Asherah pole beside it cut down, and the second bull offered up on the altar that had been built. They said to each other, Who did this? After they made a thorough investigation, they said, Gideon son of Joash did it. Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out your son. He must die because he tore down Baal’s altar and cut down the Asherah pole beside it. But Joash said to all who stood against him, Would you plead Baal’s case for him? Would you save him? Whoever pleads his case will be put to death by morning! If he is a god, let him plead his case, because someone tore down his altar. That day, he was called Jerubbaal, since Joash said, Let Baal contend with him, because he tore down his altar. All the Midianites, Amalekites, and people of the east gathered together, crossed over the Jordan, and camped in the Jezreel Valley. The Spirit of the Lord enveloped Gideon, and he blew the ram’s horn and the Abiezrites rallied behind him. He sent messengers throughout all of Manasseh, who rallied behind him. He also sent messengers throughout Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, who also came to meet him. Then Gideon said to God, If you will deliver Israel by me, as you said, I will put a wool fleece here on the threshing floor. If dew is only on the fleece, and all the ground is dry, I will know that you will deliver Israel by me, as you said. And that is what happened. When he got up early in the morning, he squeezed the fleece and wrung dew out of it, filling a bowl with water. Gideon then said to God, Don’t be angry with me, let me speak one more time. Please allow me to make one more test with the fleece. Let it remain dry, and the dew be all over the ground. That night God did as Gideon requested: only the fleece was dry, and dew was all over the ground.",

      "ChapterText": "Again the Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. So for seven years he handed them over to the people of Midian. The Midianites treated the Israelites very badly. That’s why the Israelites made places for themselves to hide in the mountains. They also made caves and strongholds. Every time the Israelites planted their crops, the people of Midian, Amalek and other nations from the east came and attacked them. They camped on the land. They destroyed the crops all the way to Gaza. They didn’t spare any living thing for Israel. They didn’t spare sheep or cattle or donkeys. The Midianites came up with their livestock and their tents. They came like a huge swarm of locusts. It was impossible to count all their men and their camels. They came into the land to destroy it. Midian made the Israelites very poor. So they cried out to the Lord for help. They cried out to the Lord because of what Midian had done. The Lord sent a prophet to the Israelites. The prophet said, The Lord is the God of Israel. He says, I brought you up out of Egypt. That is the land where you were slaves. I saved you from the power of Egypt. I saved you from all those who were treating you badly. I drove out the people who lived in the land. I gave you their land. I said to you, I am the Lord your God. Do not worship the gods of the Amorites. You are now living in their land. But you have not listened to me. The angel of the Lord came. He sat down under an oak tree in Ophrah. The tree belonged to Joash. Joash was from the family line of Abiezer. Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress. He was hiding from the Midianites. Gideon was the son of Joash. The angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon. He said, Mighty warrior, the Lord is with you. Pardon me, sir, Gideon replied. You say the Lord is with us. Then why has all of this happened to us? What about all the wonderful things he has done? Our people of long ago told us about them. They said, Didn’t the Lord bring us up out of Egypt? But now the Lord has deserted us. He has handed us over to Midian. The Lord turned to Gideon. He said to him, You are strong. Go and save Israel from the power of Midian. I am sending you. Pardon me, sir, Gideon replied. How can I possibly save Israel? My family group is the weakest in the tribe of Manasseh. And I’m the least important member of my family. The Lord answered, I will be with you. So you will strike down the Midianites. You will leave no one alive. Gideon replied, If you are pleased with me, give me a special sign. Then I’ll know that it’s really you talking to me. Please don’t go away until I come back. I’ll bring my offering and set it down in front of you. The Lord said, I will wait until you return. Gideon went and prepared a young goat. From more than half a bushel of flour he made bread without yeast. He put the meat in a basket. In a pot he put soup made from the meat. Then he brought all of it and offered it to the Lord under the oak tree. The angel of God spoke to Gideon. He said, Take the meat and the bread. Place them on this rock. Then pour out the soup. So Gideon did it. The angel of the Lord had a wooden staff in his hand. With the tip of the staff, he touched the meat and the bread. Fire blazed out from the rock. It burned up the meat and the bread. Then the angel of the Lord disappeared. Gideon realized it was the angel of the Lord. He cried out, Lord and King, I’ve seen the angel of the Lord face to face! But the Lord said to him, May peace be with you! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die. So Gideon built an altar to honor the Lord there. He called it The Lord Is Peace. To this day it stands in Ophrah. Ophrah is in the territory that belongs to the family line of Abiezer. That same night the Lord spoke to Gideon. He said, Get the second bull from your father’s herd. Get the one that is seven years old. Tear down the altar your father built to Baal. Cut down the pole that’s beside it. The pole is used to worship the female god Asherah. Then build the right kind of altar. Build it to honor the Lord your God. Build it on top of this rock. Use the proper stones. Then take the second bull. Sacrifice it as a burnt offering. Use the wood from the pole you cut down. So Gideon went and got ten of his servants. He did just as the Lord had told him. But he was afraid of his family. He was also afraid of the people in the town. So he did everything at night instead of during the day. In the morning the people in the town got up. There was Baal’s altar! It had been torn down. The pole that had been beside it had been cut down. The second bull had been sacrificed on the new altar. The people asked each other, Who did this? They looked into the matter carefully. Someone said, Gideon, the son of Joash, did it. The people in the town spoke to Joash. They ordered him, Bring your son out here. He must die. He has torn down Baal’s altar. He has cut down the Asherah pole beside it. But Joash replied to the angry crowd around him, Are you going to stand up for Baal? Are you going to save him? Anyone who stands up for Baal will be put to death by morning! If Baal really is a god, he can take care of himself. Someone tore down his altar. So from that day on, Gideon was called Jerub-Baal. That’s because Joash said, Let Baal take care of himself. Someone tore down his altar. All the Midianites, Amalekites and other nations from the east joined forces. They went across the Jordan River. They camped in the Valley of Jezreel. Then the Spirit of the Lord came on Gideon. So Gideon blew a trumpet to send for the men of Abiezer. He told them to follow him. He sent messengers all through Manasseh’s territory. He called out all the men to follow him. He also sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali. So they too went up to join the others. Gideon said to God, You promised you would use me to save Israel. Please do something for me. I’ll put a piece of wool on the threshing floor. Suppose dew is only on the wool in the morning. Suppose the ground all around it is dry. Then I’ll know that you will use me to save Israel. I’ll know that your promise will come true. And that’s just what happened. Gideon got up early the next day. He squeezed the wool. He got a full bowl of water out of it. Then Gideon spoke to God again. He said, Don’t be angry with me. Let me ask you just one more thing. Allow me to make one more test with the wool. This time make the wool dry. Let the ground be covered with dew. So that night God did it. Only the wool was dry. All the ground around it was covered with dew.",

      "ChapterText": "Los hijos de Israel hicieron lo malo ante los ojos del Señor, y el Señor los entregó en manos de los madianitas durante siete años. Los madianitas dominaron a Israel, y por culpa de ellos los israelitas se hicieron escondites en las montañas, cuevas y refugios. Cada vez que Israel sembraba, venían los madianitas, los amalecitas y los pueblos del oriente y los atacaban. Acampaban contra ellos y destruían todo lo que la tierra producía hasta llegar a Gaza, y no dejaban nada para Israel, ni ovejas, ni bueyes, ni asnos. Venían con su ganado y sus carpas, eran tantos como langostas; tanto ellos como sus camellos eran incontables, e invadían la tierra para arrasarla. Así que Israel quedó muy empobrecido por culpa de los madianitas, y los israelitas clamaron al Señor.\n\nCuando los israelitas clamaron al Señor por causa de los madianitas, el Señor les envió un profeta que les dijo: “Así dice el Señor, Dios de Israel: Yo los saqué de Egipto y los libré de la esclavitud. Los rescaté de manos de los egipcios y de todos los que los oprimían, los expulsé de delante de ustedes y les di su tierra. Les dije: ‘Yo soy el Señor su Dios; no teman a los dioses de los amorreos, en cuya tierra viven’. Pero ustedes no me obedecieron”.\n\nEntonces vino un ángel del Señor y se sentó bajo una encina en Ofra, que pertenecía a Joás el abiezerita. Su hijo Gedeón estaba sacudiendo trigo en un lagar para esconderlo de los madianitas. El ángel del Señor se le apareció y le dijo: “El Señor está contigo, valiente guerrero”. Gedeón le respondió: “Ay, Señor mío, si el Señor está con nosotros, ¿por qué nos pasa todo esto? ¿Dónde están todos esos milagros de los que nos hablaron nuestros padres, diciendo: ‘¿No nos sacó el Señor de Egipto?’ Pero ahora el Señor nos ha abandonado y nos ha entregado en manos de los madianitas”.\n\nEl Señor lo miró y le dijo: “Ve con esta fuerza que tienes y salvarás a Israel de manos de los madianitas. ¿No soy yo quien te envía?” Gedeón le respondió: “Ay, Señor mío, ¿con qué salvaré yo a Israel? Mi familia es la más pobre de Manasés, y yo soy el menor en la casa de mi padre”. El Señor le dijo: “Yo estaré contigo, y derrotarás a los madianitas como si fueran un solo hombre”. Gedeón le dijo: “Si he hallado gracia ante tus ojos, dame una señal de que eres tú quien habla conmigo. Te ruego que no te vayas de aquí hasta que vuelva y te traiga mi ofrenda y la ponga delante de ti”. El ángel le respondió: “Me quedaré hasta que regreses”.\n\nGedeón fue, preparó un cabrito y panes sin levadura con una medida de harina; puso la carne en una canasta y el caldo en una olla, y se los llevó al ángel bajo la encina y se los presentó. El ángel de Dios le dijo: “Toma la carne y los panes sin levadura, ponlos sobre esta roca y derrama el caldo encima”. Gedeón lo hizo así. Entonces el ángel del Señor extendió la punta del bastón que tenía en la mano, tocó la carne y los panes sin levadura, y de la roca salió fuego que consumió la carne y los panes. Luego el ángel del Señor desapareció de su vista.\n\nCuando Gedeón se dio cuenta de que era el ángel del Señor, exclamó: “¡Ay de mí, Señor Dios! ¡He visto al ángel del Señor cara a cara!” Pero el Señor le dijo: “Paz a ti, no temas, no morirás”. Entonces Gedeón construyó allí un altar al Señor y lo llamó “El Señor es paz”. Hasta hoy está en Ofra de los abiezeritas.\n\nEsa misma noche el Señor le dijo: “Toma el toro joven de tu padre, el segundo toro de siete años, derriba el altar de Baal que tiene tu padre y corta la imagen de Asera que está junto a él. Luego construye un altar al Señor tu Dios en la cima de este lugar fuerte, en el lugar adecuado, y ofrece el segundo toro en holocausto, usando la madera de la imagen de Asera que cortaste”. Gedeón tomó a diez de sus siervos e hizo como el Señor le había dicho. Pero, como tenía miedo de su familia y de los hombres de la ciudad, lo hizo de noche y no de día.\n\nPor la mañana, cuando los hombres de la ciudad se levantaron, vieron que el altar de Baal estaba derribado, la imagen de Asera cortada y el segundo toro ofrecido en el altar recién construido. Se preguntaron unos a otros: “¿Quién hizo esto?” Y después de investigar, dijeron: “Gedeón, hijo de Joás, lo hizo”. Entonces los hombres de la ciudad le dijeron a Joás: “Saca a tu hijo para que muera, porque ha derribado el altar de Baal y ha cortado la imagen de Asera que estaba junto a él”. Pero Joás respondió a todos los que estaban contra él: “¿Van a defender ustedes a Baal? ¿Van a salvarlo? El que quiera defenderlo, que muera antes de que amanezca. Si Baal es un dios, que se defienda él mismo, ya que han derribado su altar”. Por eso, aquel día llamaron a Gedeón “Jerobaal”, diciendo: “Que Baal contienda contra él, porque derribó su altar”.\n\nEntonces todos los madianitas, amalecitas y los pueblos del oriente se reunieron, cruzaron el río y acamparon en el valle de Jezreel. Pero el Espíritu del Señor vino sobre Gedeón, y él tocó la trompeta, y los abiezeritas se unieron a él. Mandó mensajeros por todo Manasés, que también se unió a él, y envió mensajeros a Aser, Zabulón y Neftalí, y ellos también subieron a reunirse con él.\n\nGedeón le dijo a Dios: “Si vas a salvar a Israel por mi mano, como has dicho, mira, voy a poner un vellón de lana en la era; si el rocío está solo en el vellón y toda la tierra alrededor está seca, sabré que salvarás a Israel por mi mano, como has dicho”. Y así fue: al día siguiente, Gedeón se levantó temprano, exprimió el vellón y sacó de él un tazón lleno de agua. Entonces Gedeón le dijo a Dios: “No te enojes conmigo si te pido una sola cosa más. Permíteme hacer una prueba más con el vellón: que ahora solo el vellón quede seco y que haya rocío en toda la tierra”. Y esa noche Dios lo hizo así: solo el vellón quedó seco y en toda la tierra hubo rocío.",

Se preguntaron unos a otros: “¿Quién hizo esto?” Después de investigar, dijeron: “Gedeón, hijo de Joás, lo hizo.” Entonces los hombres del pueblo le dijeron a Joás: “Saca a tu hijo para que muera, porque ha derribado el altar de Baal y ha cortado la imagen de Asera que estaba junto a él.” Pero Joás respondió a todos los que lo enfrentaban: “¿Van a defender ustedes a Baal? ¿Van a salvarlo? El que luche por él, morirá antes de que amanezca. Si Baal es un dios, que él mismo se defienda, ya que han derribado su altar.” Por eso, aquel día llamaron a Gedeón Jerobaal, diciendo: “Que Baal contienda contra él, porque derribó su altar.”\n\nEntonces todos los madianitas, amalecitas y los pueblos del oriente se reunieron, cruzaron el Jordán y acamparon en el valle de Jezreel. Pero el Espíritu del SEÑOR vino sobre Gedeón, quien tocó la trompeta, y los abiezeritas se unieron para seguirlo. Envió mensajeros por todo Manasés, que también se unió a él, y envió mensajeros a Aser, Zabulón y Neftalí, y ellos también subieron a encontrarse con él.\n\nGedeón le dijo a Dios: “Si vas a salvar a Israel por mi mano, como has dicho, voy a poner un vellón de lana en la era. Si el rocío está solo en el vellón y todo el suelo alrededor está seco, sabré que salvarás a Israel por mi mano, como has dicho.” Y así fue. Al día siguiente, Gedeón se levantó temprano, exprimió el vellón y sacó suficiente rocío como para llenar un tazón de agua. Entonces Gedeón le dijo a Dios: “No te enojes conmigo si te pido una vez más. Permíteme hacer una prueba más con el vellón: que ahora solo el vellón quede seco y que haya rocío en todo el suelo.” Y esa noche Dios lo hizo así: solo el vellón quedó seco, y en todo el suelo había rocío.",

      "ChapterText": "Los israelitas ofendieron al SEÑOR, quien por eso los entregó en manos de Madián durante siete años, y así Madián sometió a Israel. Por miedo a los madianitas, los israelitas pusieron señales de fuego en las montañas, hicieron cuevas para refugiarse y construyeron fortalezas. Y sucedía que, cuando los israelitas terminaban de sembrar, Madián, Amalec y los pueblos del oriente subían, acampaban frente a ellos y destruían la cosecha hasta las afueras de Gaza, sin dejar nada de sustento en Israel, ni ovejas, ni bueyes, ni asnos. Venían con su ganado y sus tiendas, y eran tantos como langostas; ni ellos ni sus camellos podían contarse, y entraban en la tierra para arrasarla. Así, Israel quedó sumido en la miseria por causa de Madián, y los israelitas clamaron al SEÑOR. Cuando Israel clamó al SEÑOR por causa de Madián, él envió un profeta a los israelitas, que les dijo: “Así dice el SEÑOR, Dios de Israel: Yo los saqué de Egipto, los saqué de la casa de esclavitud. Los libré del poder de Egipto y de todos sus opresores. Los expulsé delante de ustedes y les di su tierra. Y les dije: Yo soy el SEÑOR su Dios; no veneren a los dioses de los amorreos, en cuya tierra habitan. Pero ustedes no me obedecieron”.\n\nEntonces el ángel del SEÑOR vino y se sentó bajo la encina de Ofra, que pertenecía a Joás el abiezerita. Su hijo Gedeón estaba sacudiendo trigo en el lagar para esconderlo de los madianitas, cuando el ángel del SEÑOR se le apareció y le dijo: “El SEÑOR está contigo, valiente guerrero”. Gedeón le respondió: “Señor mío, si el SEÑOR está con nosotros, ¿por qué nos ha pasado todo esto? ¿Dónde están todas esas maravillas de las que nos hablaron nuestros padres, diciendo: ‘¿No nos sacó el SEÑOR de Egipto?’ Pero ahora el SEÑOR nos ha abandonado y nos ha entregado en manos de Madián”. El SEÑOR se volvió hacia él y le dijo: “Ve con la fuerza que tienes y salva a Israel del poder de Madián. Soy yo quien te envía”. Pero Gedeón le respondió: “Por favor, Señor, ¿cómo voy a salvar yo a Israel? Mi familia es la más pobre de Manasés, y yo soy el menor en la casa de mi padre”. El SEÑOR le dijo: “Yo estaré contigo, y derrotarás a Madián como si fuera un solo hombre”. Gedeón le respondió: “Si he hallado gracia ante tus ojos, dame una señal de que eres tú quien me habla. Te ruego que no te vayas de aquí hasta que vuelva y te traiga mi ofrenda y la ponga delante de ti”. El ángel le dijo: “Esperaré hasta que regreses”.\n\nGedeón fue, preparó un cabrito y con una medida de harina hizo panes sin levadura. Puso la carne en una canasta y el caldo en una olla, y se los llevó al ángel bajo la encina y se los presentó. El ángel de Dios le dijo: “Toma la carne y los panes sin levadura y ponlos sobre esta roca, y derrama el caldo encima”. Así lo hizo. Entonces el ángel del SEÑOR extendió la punta del bastón que tenía en la mano, tocó la carne y los panes sin levadura, y de la roca salió fuego que consumió la carne y los panes. Y el ángel del SEÑOR desapareció de su vista. Al darse cuenta Gedeón de que era el ángel del SEÑOR, exclamó: “¡Ay de mí, Señor DIOS! ¡He visto al ángel del SEÑOR cara a cara!” Pero el SEÑOR le dijo: “Tranquilo, no temas. No vas a morir”. Así que Gedeón construyó allí un altar al SEÑOR y lo llamó Yahvé-shalom. Hasta hoy está en Ofra de los abiezeritas.\n\nEsa misma noche el SEÑOR le dijo: “Toma el toro de siete años que tienes y destruye el altar de Baal que es de tu padre, y corta el poste sagrado que está junto a él. Luego construye un altar apropiado al SEÑOR tu Dios en la cima de esta fortaleza. Toma el toro y ofrécelo en holocausto sobre la leña del poste sagrado que cortaste”. Gedeón tomó a diez de sus siervos e hizo como el SEÑOR le había mandado. Pero, por miedo a su familia y a la gente del pueblo, lo hizo de noche y no de día.\n\nA la mañana siguiente, la gente del pueblo vio que el altar de Baal había sido destruido, el poste sagrado cortado y el toro ofrecido en el altar que se había construido. Se preguntaron unos a otros: “¿Quién hizo esto?” Después de investigar, concluyeron que había sido Gedeón, hijo de Joás. Entonces la gente del pueblo le dijo a Joás: “Saca a tu hijo para que muera, porque ha destruido el altar de Baal y ha cortado el poste sagrado que estaba junto a él”. Pero Joás respondió a todos los que estaban con él: “¿Van a defender ustedes a Baal? ¿Van a salvarlo? El que quiera defenderlo, que muera antes de mañana. Si Baal es un dios, que se defienda él mismo, ya que han destruido su altar”. Por eso, aquel día llamaron a Gedeón Jerubaal, diciendo: “¡Que Baal contienda contra él, ya que destruyó su altar!”\n\nEntonces todos los madianitas, amalecitas y los pueblos del oriente se reunieron, cruzaron el Jordán y acamparon en el valle de Jezreel. El espíritu del SEÑOR vino sobre Gedeón, quien tocó la trompeta y reunió a los abiezeritas para que lo siguieran. También envió mensajeros por todo Manasés, que se unió a él; y envió mensajeros a Aser, Zabulón y Neftalí, y ellos también subieron a reunirse con los demás.\n\nGedeón le dijo a Dios: “Si de verdad vas a salvar a Israel por medio de mí, como has dicho, voy a poner un vellón de lana en la era. Si el rocío cae solo sobre el vellón y todo el suelo queda seco, sabré que salvarás a Israel por medio de mí, como has dicho”. Y así fue. Al día siguiente, Gedeón se levantó temprano, exprimió el vellón y sacó de él un tazón lleno de agua. Entonces Gedeón le dijo a Dios: “No te enojes conmigo si hablo una vez más. Permíteme hacer una prueba más con el vellón: que solo el vellón quede seco y que el rocío caiga sobre todo el suelo”. Aquella noche Dios lo hizo así: solo el vellón quedó seco, mientras que todo el suelo estaba cubierto de rocío.",

All men lie in wait to shed blood; each hunts his brother with a net. | Both hands are skilled in doing evil; the ruler demands gifts, the judge accepts bribes, the powerful dictate what they desire- they all conspire together. | The best of them is like a brier, the most upright worse than a thorn hedge. The day of your watchmen has come, the day God visits you. Now is the time of their confusion. | Do not trust a neighbor; put no confidence in a friend. Even with her who lies in your embrace be careful of your words. | For a son dishonors his father, a daughter rises up against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law- a man's enemies are the members of his own household. | But as for me, I watch in hope for the LORD, I wait for God my Savior; my God will hear me. | Do not gloat over me, my enemy! Though I have fallen, I will rise. Though I sit in darkness, the LORD will be my light. | Because I have sinned against him, I will bear the LORD's wrath, until he pleads my case and establishes my right.

They will lay their hands on their mouths and their ears will become deaf. | They will lick dust like a snake, like creatures that crawl on the ground. They will come trembling out of their dens; they will turn in fear to the LORD our God and will be afraid of you. | Who is a God like you, who pardons sin and forgives the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance? You do not stay angry forever but delight to show mercy. | You will again have compassion on us; you will tread our sins underfoot and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea. | You will be true to Jacob, and show mercy to Abraham, as you pledged on oath to our fathers in days long ago.",

      "ChapterText": "How miserable I am! I feel like the fruit picker after the harvest who can find nothing to eat. Not a cluster of grapes or a single early fig can be found to satisfy my hunger. | The godly people have all disappeared; not one honest person is left on the earth. They are all murderers, setting traps even for their own brothers. | Both their hands are equally skilled at doing evil! Officials and judges alike demand bribes. The people with influence get what they want, and together they scheme to twist justice. | Even the best of them is as crooked as a briar; the most honest is as dangerous as a hedge of thorns. But your judgment day is coming swiftly now. Your time of punishment is here, a time of confusion. | Don’t trust anyone— not your best friend or even your wife! | For the son despises his father. The daughter defies her mother. The daughter-in-law defies her mother-in-law. Your enemies are right in your own household! | As for me, I look to the Lord for help. I wait confidently for God to save me, and my God will certainly hear me. | Do not gloat over me, my enemies! For though I fall, I will rise again. Though I sit in darkness, the Lord will be my light. | I will be patient as the Lord punishes me, for I have sinned against him. But after that, he will take up my case and give me justice for all I have suffered from my enemies. The Lord will bring me into the light, and I will see his righteousness. | Then my enemies will see that the Lord is on my side. They will be ashamed that they taunted me, saying, “So where is the Lord— that God of yours?” With my own eyes I will see their downfall; they will be trampled like mud in the streets. | In that day, Israel, your cities will be rebuilt, and your borders will be extended. | People from many lands will come and honor you— from Assyria all the way to the towns of Egypt, from Egypt all the way to the Euphrates River, and from distant seas and mountains. | But the land will become empty and desolate because of the wickedness of those who live there. | O Lord, protect your people with your shepherd’s staff; lead your flock, your special possession. Though they live alone in a thicket on the heights of Mount Carmel, let them graze in the fertile pastures of Bashan and Gilead as they did long ago. | “Yes,” says the Lord, “I will do mighty miracles for you, like those I did when I rescued you from slavery in Egypt.” | All the nations of the world will stand amazed at what the Lord will do for you. They will be embarrassed at their feeble power. They will cover their mouths in silent awe, deaf to everything around them. | Like snakes crawling from their holes, they will come out to meet the Lord our God. They will fear him greatly, trembling in terror at his presence. | Where is another God like you, who pardons the guilt of the remnant, overlooking the sins of his special people? You will not stay angry with your people forever, because you delight in showing unfailing love. | Once again you will have compassion on us. You will trample our sins under your feet and throw them into the depths of the ocean! | You will show us your faithfulness and unfailing love as you promised to our ancestors Abraham and Jacob long ago.",

All of them wait in ambush to shed blood; they hunt each other with a net. | Both hands are good at accomplishing evil: the official and the judge demand a bribe; when the powerful man communicates his evil desire, they plot it together. | The best of them is like a brier; the most upright is worse than a hedge of thorns. The day of your watchmen, the day of your punishment, is coming; at this time their panic is here. | Do not rely on a friend; don’t trust in a close companion. Seal your mouth from the woman who lies in your arms. | Surely a son considers his father a fool, a daughter opposes her mother, and a daughter-in-law is against her mother-in-law; a person’s enemies are the people in his own home. | But I will look to the Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me. | Do not rejoice over me, my enemy! Though I have fallen, I will stand up; though I sit in darkness, the Lord will be my light. | Because I have sinned against him, I must endure the Lord’s fury until he champions my cause and establishes justice for me. He will bring me into the light; I will see his salvation. | Then my enemy will see, and she will be covered with shame, the one who said to me, “Where is the Lord your God?” My eyes will look at her in triumph; at that time she will be trampled like mud in the streets. | A day will come for rebuilding your walls; on that day your boundary will be extended. | On that day people will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, even from Egypt to the Euphrates River and from sea to sea and mountain to mountain. | Then the earth will become a wasteland because of its inhabitants and as a result of their actions. | Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock that is your possession. They live alone in a woodland surrounded by pastures. Let them graze in Bashan and Gilead as in ancient times. | I will perform miracles for them as in the days of your exodus from the land of Egypt. | Nations will see and be ashamed of all their power. They will put their hands over their mouths, and their ears will become deaf. | They will lick the dust like a snake; they will come trembling out of their hiding places like reptiles slithering on the ground. They will tremble in awe of the Lord our God, and they will fear you. | Who is a God like you, forgiving iniquity and passing over rebellion for the remnant of his inheritance? He does not hold on to his anger forever, because he delights in faithful love. | He will again have compassion on us; he will vanquish our iniquities. You will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea. | You will show loyalty to Jacob and faithful love to Abraham, as you swore to our ancestors from days long ago.",

You forgive your people when they do what is wrong. You don’t stay angry forever. Instead, you take delight in showing your faithful love to them. | Once again you will show loving concern for us.

El día de tus centinelas, el día de tu castigo, ha llegado; ahora será su confusión. | No confíes en tu amigo, ni pongas tu esperanza en un guía; cuida lo que dices incluso a la que duerme en tu pecho. | Porque el hijo deshonra al padre, la hija se levanta contra su madre, la nuera contra su suegra; los enemigos de un hombre son los de su propia casa. | Por eso, yo miraré al SEÑOR; esperaré en el Dios de mi salvación; mi Dios me escuchará. | No te alegres de mí, enemiga mía; aunque caiga, me levantaré; aunque more en tinieblas, el SEÑOR será mi luz. | Soportaré la ira del SEÑOR, porque pequé contra él, hasta que defienda mi causa y haga justicia por mí; él me sacará a la luz, y veré su justicia. | Entonces mi enemiga lo verá, y la cubrirá la vergüenza, la que me decía: “¿Dónde está el SEÑOR, tu Dios?” Mis ojos la verán; ahora será pisoteada como lodo en las calles. | El día en que se edificarán tus muros, ese día se alejará el decreto. | Ese día vendrán hasta ti desde Asiria, y desde las ciudades fortificadas, y desde la fortaleza hasta el río, y de mar a mar, y de monte a monte. | Pero la tierra quedará desolada a causa de los que la habitan, por el fruto de sus obras. | Apacienta a tu pueblo con tu cayado, el rebaño de tu heredad, que mora solo en el bosque, en medio del Carmelo; que pasten en Basán y Galaad, como en los días antiguos. | Como en los días en que saliste de la tierra de Egipto, te mostraré maravillas. | Las naciones verán y se avergonzarán de todo su poder; pondrán la mano sobre su boca, sus oídos quedarán sordos. | Lamerán el polvo como la serpiente, como los reptiles de la tierra saldrán temblando de sus escondites; tendrán miedo del SEÑOR nuestro Dios, y temerán delante de ti. | ¿Qué Dios hay como tú, que perdona la iniquidad y olvida el pecado del remanente de su heredad?

Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every man unto his own house. | Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit. | And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands. | Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the LORD. | Then spake Haggai the LORD's messenger in the LORD's message unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith the LORD. | And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God, | In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.",

His name was Mephibosheth. | Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, set out and arrived at Ish-bosheth’s house during the heat of the day while he was taking his midday nap. | They entered the interior of the house as if to get wheat and stabbed him in the stomach. Then Rechab and his brother Baanah escaped. | They entered the house while Ish-bosheth was lying on his bed in his bedroom and stabbed and killed him. They removed his head, took it, and traveled by way of the Arabah all night. | They brought Ish-bosheth’s head to David at Hebron and said to the king, \"Here’s the head of Ish-bosheth son of Saul, your enemy who intended to take your life. Today the Lord has granted vengeance to my lord the king against Saul and his offspring.\" | But David answered Rechab and his brother Baanah, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, \"As the Lord lives, the one who has redeemed my life from every distress,\" | \"when the person told me, ‘Look, Saul is dead,’ he thought he was a bearer of good news, but I seized him and put him to death at Ziklag. That was my reward to him for his news!\" | \"How much more when wicked men kill a righteous man on his own bed in his house! So now, should I not require his blood from you and purge you from the earth?\" | So David gave orders to the young men, and they killed Rechab and Baanah, cut off their hands and feet, and hung their bodies by the pool in Hebron. But they took Ish-bosheth’s head and buried it in Abner’s tomb in Hebron.",

And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvelously helped, till he was strong. | But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense. | And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men: | And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honor from the LORD God. | Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar. | And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him. | And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land. | Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write. | So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.",

He had people working his fields and vineyards in the hills and in the fertile lands, for he loved the soil. | Uzziah had a well-trained army, ready to go out by divisions according to their numbers as mustered by Jeiel the secretary and Maaseiah the officer under the direction of Hananiah, one of the royal officials. | The total number of family leaders over the fighting men was 2,600. | Under their command was an army of 307,500 men trained for war, a powerful force to support the king against his enemies. | Uzziah provided shields, spears, helmets, coats of armor, bows and slingstones for the entire army. | In Jerusalem he made machines designed by skillful men for use on the towers and on the corner defenses to shoot arrows and hurl large stones. His fame spread far and wide, for he was greatly helped until he became powerful. | But after Uzziah became powerful, his pride led to his downfall. He was unfaithful to the LORD his God, and entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense. | Azariah the priest with eighty other courageous priests of the LORD followed him in. | They confronted him and said, \"It is not right for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD.

Leave the sanctuary, for you have been unfaithful; and you will not be honored by the LORD God.\" | Uzziah, who had a censer in his hand ready to burn incense, became angry. While he was raging at the priests in their presence before the incense altar in the LORD's temple, leprosy broke out on his forehead. | When Azariah the chief priest and all the other priests looked at him, they saw that he had leprosy on his forehead, so they hurried him out. Indeed, he himself was eager to leave, because the LORD had afflicted him. | King Uzziah had leprosy until the day he died. He lived in a separate house -leprous, and excluded from the temple of the LORD.

      "ChapterText": "And all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah. | He built Eloth and restored it to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers. | Uzziah was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. | And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done. | He set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear of God, and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him prosper. | He went out and made war against the Philistines and broke through the wall of Gath and the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod, and he built cities in the territory of Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines. | God helped him against the Philistines and against the Arabians who lived in Gurbaal and against the Meunites. | The Ammonites paid tribute to Uzziah, and his fame spread even to the border of Egypt, for he became very strong. | Moreover, Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate and at the Valley Gate and at the Angle, and fortified them. | And he built towers in the wilderness and cut out many cisterns, for he had large herds, both in the Shephelah and in the plain, and he had farmers and vinedressers in the hills and in the fertile lands, for he loved the soil. | Moreover, Uzziah had an army of soldiers, fit for war, in divisions according to the numbers in the muster made by Jeiel the secretary and Maaseiah the officer, under the direction of Hananiah, one of the king's commanders. | The whole number of the heads of fathers' houses of mighty men of valor was 2,600. | Under their command was an army of 307,500, who could make war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy. | And Uzziah prepared for all the army shields, spears, helmets, coats of mail, bows, and stones for slinging. | In Jerusalem he made engines, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and the corners, to shoot arrows and great stones. And his fame spread far, for he was marvelously helped, till he was strong. | But when he was strong, he grew proud, to his destruction. For he was unfaithful to the LORD his God and entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense. | But Azariah the priest went in after him, with eighty priests of the LORD who were men of valor, | and they withstood King Uzziah and said to him, \"It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD, but for the priests the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Go out of the sanctuary, for you have done wrong, and it will bring you no honor from the LORD God.\" | Then Uzziah was angry. Now he had a censer in his hand to burn incense, and when he became angry with the priests, leprosy broke out on his forehead in the presence of the priests in the house of the LORD, by the altar of incense. | And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him, and behold, he was leprous in his forehead! And they rushed him out quickly, and he himself hurried to go out, because the LORD had struck him. | And King Uzziah was a leper to the day of his death, and being a leper lived in a separate house, for he was excluded from the house of the LORD. And Jotham his son was over the king's household, governing the people of the land. | Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from first to last, Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz wrote. | And Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the burial field that belonged to the kings, for they said, \"He is a leper.\" And Jotham his son reigned in his place.",

His mother, named Jecoliah, was from Jerusalem. | He pleased the LORD, just as his father Amaziah had done. | He was prepared to seek God as long as Zechariah lived, who taught him to fear God; and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him prosper. | He went out and fought the Philistines and razed the walls of Gath, Jabneh and Ashdod (and built cities in the district of Ashdod and in Philistia). | God helped him against the Philistines, against the Arabs who dwelt in Gurbaal, and against the Meunites. | The Ammonites paid tribute to Uzziah and his fame spread as far as Egypt, for he grew stronger and stronger. | Moreover, Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and at the Angle, and he fortified them. | He built towers in the desert and dug numerous cisterns, for he had many cattle. He had plowmen in the foothills and the plains, and vinedressers in the highlands and the garden land. He was a lover of the soil. | Uzziah also had a standing army of fit soldiers divided into bands according to the number in which they were mustered by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the recorder, under the command of Hananiah, one of the king's officials. | The entire number of family heads over these valiant warriors was two thousand six hundred, | and at their disposal was a mighty army of three hundred seven thousand five hundred fighting men of great valor to help the king against his enemies. | Uzziah provided for them-- for the entire army-- bucklers, lances, helmets, breastplates, bows and slingstones. | He also built machines in Jerusalem, devices contrived to stand on the towers and at the angles of the walls to shoot arrows and cast large stones. His fame spread far and wide, and his power was ascribed to the marvelous help he had received. | But after he had become strong, he became proud to his own destruction and broke faith with the LORD, his God. He entered the temple of the LORD to make an offering on the altar of incense. | But Azariah the priest, and with him eighty other priests of the LORD, courageous men, followed him. | They opposed King Uzziah, saying to him: \"It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD, but for the priests, the sons of Aaron, who have been consecrated for this purpose. Leave the sanctuary, for you have broken faith and no longer have a part in the glory that comes from the LORD God.\" | Uzziah, who was holding a censer for burning the incense, became angry, but at the moment he showed his anger to the priests, while they were looking at him in the house of the LORD beside the altar of incense, leprosy broke out on his forehead. | Azariah the chief priest and all the other priests examined him, and when they saw that his forehead was leprous, they expelled him from the temple. He himself fled willingly, for the LORD had afflicted him. | King Uzziah remained a leper to the day of his death. As a leper he dwelt in a segregated house, for he was excluded from the house of the LORD. Therefore his son Jotham was regent of the palace and ruled the people of the land. | The prophet Isaiah, son of Amos, wrote the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last. | Uzziah rested with his ancestors; he was buried with them in the field adjoining the royal cemetery, for they said, \"He was a leper.\" His son Jotham succeeded him as king.",

His mother was Jecoliah from Jerusalem. | He did what was pleasing in the Lord’s sight, just as his father, Amaziah, had done. | Uzziah sought God during the days of Zechariah, who taught him to fear God. And as long as the king sought guidance from the Lord, God gave him success. | Uzziah declared war on the Philistines and broke down the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod. Then he built new towns in the Ashdod area and in other parts of Philistia. | God helped him in his wars against the Philistines, his battles with the Arabs of Gur, and his wars with the Meunites. | The Meunites paid annual tribute to him, and his fame spread even to Egypt, for he had become very powerful. | Uzziah built fortified towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and at the angle in the wall. He also constructed forts in the wilderness and dug many water cisterns, because he kept great herds of livestock in the foothills of Judah and on the plains. He was also a man who loved the soil. He had many workers who cared for his farms and vineyards, both on the hillsides and in the fertile valleys. | Uzziah had a well-organized army, ready to march out to battle unit by unit. This army had been mustered and organized by Jeiel, the secretary of the army, and his assistant, Maaseiah. They were under the direction of Hananiah, one of the king’s officials. | These regiments of mighty warriors were commanded by 2,600 clan leaders. | The army consisted of 307,500 men, all elite troops. They were prepared to assist the king against any enemy. | Uzziah provided the entire army with shields, spears, helmets, coats of mail, bows, and sling stones. | And he built structures on the walls of Jerusalem, designed by experts to protect those who shot arrows and hurled large stones from the towers and the corners of the wall. His fame spread far and wide, for the Lord gave him marvelous help, and he became very powerful. | But when he had become powerful, he also became proud, which led to his downfall. He sinned against the Lord his God by entering the sanctuary of the Lord’s Temple and personally burning incense on the incense altar. | Azariah the high priest went in after him with eighty other priests of the Lord, all brave men. | They confronted King Uzziah and said, “It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the Lord. That is the work of the priests alone, the descendants of Aaron, who are set apart for this work. Get out of the sanctuary, for you have sinned. The Lord God will not honor you for this!” | Uzziah, who was holding an incense burner, became furious. But as he was standing there raging at the priests before the incense altar in the Lord’s Temple, leprosy suddenly broke out on his forehead. | When Azariah and the other priests saw the leprosy, they rushed him out. And the king himself was eager to get out because the Lord had struck him. | So King Uzziah had leprosy until the day he died. He lived in isolation in a separate house, for he was excluded from the Temple of the Lord. His son Jotham was put in charge of the royal palace, and he governed the people of the land. | The rest of the events of Uzziah’s reign, from beginning to end, are recorded by the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. | When Uzziah died, he was buried with his ancestors; his grave was in a nearby burial field belonging to the kings, for the people said, “He had leprosy.” And his son Jotham became the next king.",

      "ChapterText": "Entonces todo el pueblo de Judá tomó a Uzías, que tenía dieciséis años, y lo hicieron rey en lugar de su padre Amasías. Uzías reconstruyó Elot y la devolvió a Judá después de que el rey murió. Uzías tenía dieciséis años cuando comenzó a reinar, y reinó cincuenta y dos años en Jerusalén. Su madre se llamaba Jecolía, de Jerusalén. Uzías hizo lo que era correcto ante los ojos del SEÑOR, tal como lo había hecho su padre Amasías. Durante los días de Zacarías, que entendía las visiones de Dios, Uzías buscó a Dios; y mientras buscó al SEÑOR, Dios lo hizo prosperar.\n\nUzías salió a luchar contra los filisteos, derribó el muro de Gat, el muro de Jabne y el muro de Asdod, y construyó ciudades alrededor de Asdod y entre los filisteos. Dios lo ayudó contra los filisteos, contra los árabes que vivían en Gurbaal y contra los meunitas. Los amonitas le pagaban tributo a Uzías, y su fama llegó hasta la entrada de Egipto, porque se hizo muy poderoso.\n\nAdemás, Uzías construyó torres en Jerusalén, en la puerta de la esquina, en la puerta del valle y en el ángulo del muro, y las fortificó. También construyó torres en el desierto y cavó muchos pozos, porque tenía mucho ganado tanto en la llanura como en los valles. También tenía agricultores y viñadores en los montes y en el Carmelo, porque le gustaba la agricultura.\n\nUzías tenía un ejército de hombres valientes que salían a la guerra en divisiones, según el censo hecho por Jeiel, el escriba, y Maaseías, el oficial, bajo la dirección de Hananías, uno de los capitanes del rey. El número total de los jefes de familia de los valientes era de dos mil seiscientos. Bajo su mando había un ejército de trescientos siete mil quinientos hombres preparados para la guerra, con gran poder, para ayudar al rey contra el enemigo.\n\nUzías preparó para todo el ejército escudos, lanzas, cascos, corazas, arcos y hondas para tirar piedras. En Jerusalén hizo máquinas inventadas por ingenieros, que colocó en las torres y en las esquinas de las murallas para lanzar flechas y grandes piedras. Su fama se extendió mucho, porque fue ayudado maravillosamente hasta que se hizo fuerte.\n\nPero cuando se hizo fuerte, su corazón se llenó de orgullo y eso lo llevó a su ruina. Pecó contra el SEÑOR su Dios, entrando en el templo del SEÑOR para quemar incienso en el altar del incienso. El sacerdote Azarías entró tras él, junto con ochenta sacerdotes del SEÑOR, hombres valientes. Se enfrentaron al rey Uzías y le dijeron: “No te corresponde a ti, Uzías, quemar incienso al SEÑOR, sino a los sacerdotes, hijos de Aarón, que han sido consagrados para hacerlo. Sal del santuario, porque has pecado, y eso no te traerá honra delante del SEÑOR Dios”.\n\nUzías, que tenía un incensario en la mano para quemar incienso, se enojó. Mientras discutía con los sacerdotes, la lepra le brotó en la frente delante de los sacerdotes, en la casa del SEÑOR, junto al altar del incienso. Cuando el sumo sacerdote Azarías y todos los sacerdotes lo miraron, vieron que tenía lepra en la frente, y lo sacaron rápidamente de allí; y él mismo se apresuró a salir, porque el SEÑOR lo había herido.\n\nEl rey Uzías fue leproso hasta el día de su muerte, y vivió en una casa apartada, porque estaba excluido de la casa del SEÑOR. Su hijo Jotam se encargó del palacio real y gobernaba al pueblo de la tierra.

Él fue quien reconstruyó Elat y la devolvió a Judá después de que Amasías descansó con sus antepasados. Uzías tenía dieciséis años cuando comenzó a reinar, y reinó en Jerusalén cincuenta y dos años. Su madre se llamaba Jecolía y era de Jerusalén. Uzías hizo lo que era correcto ante los ojos del SEÑOR, igual que su padre Amasías. Buscó a Dios durante los días de Zacarías, quien lo instruyó en el temor de Dios. Mientras buscó al SEÑOR, Dios le dio éxito.\n\nFue a la guerra contra los filisteos y derribó los muros de Gat, Jabné y Asdod. Luego reconstruyó ciudades cerca de Asdod y en otras partes entre los filisteos. Dios lo ayudó contra los filisteos, contra los árabes que vivían en Gur Baal y contra los meunitas. Los amonitas le pagaban tributo a Uzías, y su fama se extendió hasta la frontera de Egipto, porque se había hecho muy poderoso.\n\nUzías construyó torres en Jerusalén, en la Puerta de la Esquina, en la Puerta del Valle y en el ángulo del muro, y las fortificó. También construyó torres en el desierto y cavó muchas cisternas, porque tenía mucho ganado en las colinas y en la llanura. Tenía gente trabajando en sus campos y viñedos en las colinas y en las tierras fértiles, porque amaba la agricultura.\n\nUzías tenía un ejército bien entrenado, listo para salir en divisiones según el número de hombres contados por Jeiel, el secretario, y por Maasías, el oficial, bajo la dirección de Hananías, uno de los funcionarios del rey. El número total de jefes de familia al mando de los guerreros era de 2,600. Bajo su mando había un ejército de 307,500 hombres entrenados para la guerra, una fuerza poderosa para apoyar al rey contra sus enemigos. Uzías proveyó escudos, lanzas, cascos, corazas, arcos y piedras para honda para todo el ejército.\n\nEn Jerusalén hizo máquinas diseñadas por expertos para usarlas en las torres y en las esquinas de las murallas, para lanzar flechas y grandes piedras. Su fama se extendió por todas partes, porque fue grandemente ayudado hasta que se hizo poderoso.\n\nPero cuando Uzías se hizo poderoso, su orgullo lo llevó a la ruina. Fue infiel al SEÑOR su Dios y entró en el templo del SEÑOR para quemar incienso en el altar del incienso. El sacerdote Azarías, junto con ochenta valientes sacerdotes del SEÑOR, lo siguieron. Lo enfrentaron y le dijeron: \"No te corresponde a ti, Uzías, quemar incienso al SEÑOR. Eso es para los sacerdotes, descendientes de Aarón, que han sido consagrados para quemar incienso. Sal del santuario, porque has sido infiel; y no serás honrado por el SEÑOR Dios\".\n\nUzías, que tenía un incensario en la mano listo para quemar incienso, se enojó. Mientras les gritaba a los sacerdotes delante del altar del incienso en el templo del SEÑOR, la lepra le brotó en la frente. Cuando Azarías, el sumo sacerdote, y los demás sacerdotes lo vieron, notaron que tenía lepra en la frente, así que lo sacaron rápidamente. De hecho, él mismo tenía prisa por salir, porque el SEÑOR lo había herido.\n\nEl rey Uzías tuvo lepra hasta el día de su muerte. Vivió en una casa separada, leproso y excluido del templo del SEÑOR. Jotam, su hijo, se encargó del palacio y gobernaba al pueblo de la tierra. Los demás hechos del reinado de Uzías, desde el principio hasta el fin, están escritos por el profeta Isaías, hijo de Amoz.\n\nUzías descansó con sus antepasados y fue enterrado cerca de ellos en un campo de sepultura que pertenecía a los reyes, porque decían: \"Tenía lepra\".

Uzías tenía dieciséis años cuando se convirtió en rey y reinó cincuenta y dos años en Jerusalén. Su madre, Jecolía, era de Jerusalén. Uzías hizo lo que agradaba al SEÑOR, igual que su padre Amasías. Mientras vivió Zacarías, quien le enseñó a temer a Dios, Uzías buscó al SEÑOR, y mientras lo buscó, Dios lo hizo prosperar.\n\nUzías salió a pelear contra los filisteos y derribó los muros de Gat, Jabné y Asdod; además, construyó ciudades en la región de Asdod y en Filistea. Dios lo ayudó contra los filisteos, contra los árabes que vivían en Gurbaal y contra los meunitas. Los amonitas le pagaban tributo a Uzías y su fama llegó hasta Egipto, porque se hacía cada vez más poderoso.\n\nAdemás, Uzías construyó torres en Jerusalén, en la Puerta de la Esquina, en la Puerta del Valle y en el Ángulo, y las fortificó. También construyó torres en el desierto y cavó muchas cisternas, porque tenía mucho ganado. Tenía agricultores en las colinas y en las llanuras, y viñadores en las montañas y en los campos fértiles. Le encantaba trabajar la tierra.\n\nUzías también tenía un ejército permanente de soldados aptos, organizados en divisiones según el censo hecho por Jeiel, el escriba, y Maasías, el cronista, bajo el mando de Hananías, uno de los oficiales del rey. El número total de jefes de familia al mando de estos valientes era de dos mil seiscientos, y bajo sus órdenes había un ejército poderoso de trescientos siete mil quinientos soldados valientes, listos para ayudar al rey contra sus enemigos. Uzías les proveyó a todos—al ejército completo—escudos, lanzas, cascos, corazas, arcos y piedras para hondas.\n\nTambién construyó en Jerusalén máquinas diseñadas para colocarse en las torres y en las esquinas de los muros, para lanzar flechas y grandes piedras. Su fama se extendió por todas partes, y su poder se atribuía a la ayuda maravillosa que había recibido.\n\nPero cuando Uzías se hizo fuerte, se llenó de orgullo y eso lo llevó a su ruina.

Sal del santuario, porque has pecado y ya no tienes parte en el honor que viene del SEÑOR Dios”.\n\nUzías, que tenía en la mano un incensario para quemar el incienso, se enojó, pero en ese mismo momento, mientras les mostraba su enojo a los sacerdotes y ellos lo miraban en el templo, junto al altar del incienso, la lepra le brotó en la frente. Azarías, el sumo sacerdote, y los demás sacerdotes lo miraron y, al ver que tenía lepra en la frente, lo echaron rápidamente del templo.

And Athaliah did reign over the land. | And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and showed them the king's son. | And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house; | And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down. | And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king. | And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in. | And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest. | And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the LORD. | And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple, along by the altar and the temple. | And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king. | And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD. | And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason. | But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without the ranges: and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD. | And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she slain. | And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people, that they should be the LORD's people; between the king also and the people. | And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD. | And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house.

She put him and his nurse in a bedroom to hide him from Athaliah; so he was not killed. | He remained hidden with his nurse at the temple of the LORD for six years while Athaliah ruled the land. | In the seventh year Jehoiada sent for the commanders of units of a hundred, the Carites and the guards and had them brought to him at the temple of the LORD.

Each one took his men-those who were going on duty on the Sabbath and those who were going off duty-and came to Jehoiada the priest. | Then he gave the commanders the spears and shields that had belonged to King David and that were in the temple of the LORD. | The guards, each with his weapon in his hand, stationed themselves around the king-near the altar and the temple, from the south side to the north side of the temple. | Jehoiada brought out the king's son and put the crown on him; he presented him with a copy of the covenant and proclaimed him king. They anointed him, and the people clapped their hands and shouted, \"Long live the king!\" | When Athaliah heard the noise made by the guards and the people, she went to the people at the temple of the LORD. | She looked and there was the king, standing by the pillar, as the custom was. The officers and the trumpeters were beside the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her robes and called out, \"Treason!

He also made a covenant between the king and the people. | All the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols to pieces and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars. Then Jehoiada the priest posted guards at the temple of the LORD. | He took with him the commanders of hundreds, the Carites, the guards and all the people of the land, and together they brought the king down from the temple of the LORD and went into the palace, entering by way of the gate of the guards.

      "ChapterText": "When Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, saw that her son was dead, she began to kill off the whole royal family. | But Jehosheba, daughter of King Jehoram and sister of Ahaziah, took Joash, his son, and spirited him away, along with his nurse, from the bedroom where the princes were about to be slain. She concealed him from Athaliah, and so he did not die. | For six years he remained hidden in the temple of the LORD, while Athaliah ruled the land. | But in the seventh year, Jehoiada summoned the captains of the Carians and of the guards. He had them come to him in the temple of the LORD, exacted from them a sworn commitment, and then showed them the king's son. | He gave them these orders: \"This is what you must do: the third of you who come on duty on the sabbath shall guard the king's palace; | another third shall be at the gate Sur; and the last third shall be at the gate behind the guards. | The two of your divisions who are going off duty that week shall keep guard over the temple of the LORD for the king. | You shall surround the king, each with drawn weapons, and if anyone tries to approach the cordon, kill him; stay with the king, whatever he may do.\" | The captains did just as Jehoiada the priest commanded. Each one with his men, both those going on duty for the sabbath and those going off duty that week, came to Jehoiada the priest. | He gave the captains King David's spears and shields, which were in the temple of the LORD. | And the guards, with drawn weapons, lined up from the southern to the northern limit of the enclosure, surrounding the altar and the temple on the king's behalf. | Then Jehoiada led out the king's son and put the crown and the insignia upon him. They proclaimed him king and anointed him, clapping their hands and shouting, \"Long live the king!\" | Athaliah heard the noise made by the people, and appeared before them in the temple of the LORD. | When she saw the king standing by the pillar, as was the custom, and the captains and trumpeters near him, with all the people of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets, she tore her garments and cried out, \"Treason, treason!\" | Then Jehoiada the priest instructed the captains in command of the force: \"Bring her outside through the ranks. If anyone follows her,\" he added, \"let him die by the sword.\" He had given orders that she should not be slain in the temple of the LORD. | She was led out forcibly to the horse gate of the royal palace, where she was put to death. | Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD as one party and the king and the people as the other, by which they would be the LORD'S people; and another covenant, between the king and the people. | Thereupon all the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and demolished it. They shattered its altars and images completely, and slew Mattan, the priest of Baal, before the altars. After appointing a detachment for the temple of the LORD, Jehoiada | with the captains, the Carians, the guards, and all the people of the land, led the king down from the temple of the LORD through the guards' gate to the palace, where Joash took his seat on the royal throne. | All the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet, now that Athaliah had been slain with the sword at the royal palace.",

      "ChapterText": "When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal heirs. | But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the king’s sons who were being murdered; and they hid him and his nurse in the bedroom, from Athaliah, so that he was not killed. | So he was hidden with her in the house of the Lord for six years, while Athaliah reigned over the land. | In the seventh year Jehoiada sent and brought the captains of hundreds—of the bodyguards and the escorts—and brought them into the house of the Lord to him. And he made a covenant with them and took an oath from them in the house of the Lord, and showed them the king’s son. | Then he commanded them, saying, “This is what you shall do: One-third of you who come on duty on the Sabbath shall be keeping watch over the king’s house, | one-third shall be at the gate of Sur, and one-third at the gate behind the escorts; you shall keep the watch of the house, lest it be broken down. | The two contingents of you who go off duty on the Sabbath shall keep the watch of the house of the Lord for the king. | But you shall surround the king on all sides, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever comes within range, let him be put to death. You are to be with the king as he goes out and as he comes in.” | So the captains of the hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. Each of them took his men who were to be on duty on the Sabbath, with those who were going off duty on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest. | And the priest gave the captains of hundreds the spears and shields which had belonged to King David, that were in the temple of the Lord. | Then the escorts stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, all around the king, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, by the altar and the house. | And he brought out the king’s son, put the crown on him, and gave him the Testimony; they made him king and anointed him, and they clapped their hands and said, “Long live the king!” | Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the escorts and the people, she came to the people in the temple of the Lord. | When she looked, there was the king standing by a pillar according to custom; and the leaders and the trumpeters were by the king. All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. So Athaliah tore her clothes and cried out, “Treason! Treason!” | And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the army, and said to them, “Take her outside under guard, and slay with the sword whoever follows her.” For the priest had said, “Do not let her be killed in the house of the Lord.” | So they seized her; and she went by way of the horses’ entrance into the king’s house, and there she was killed. | Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the Lord, the king, and the people, that they should be the Lord’s people, and also between the king and the people. | And all the people of the land went to the temple of Baal, and tore it down. They thoroughly broke in pieces its altars and images, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the Lord. | Then he took the captains of hundreds, the bodyguards, the escorts, and all the people of the land; and they brought the king down from the house of the Lord, and went by way of the gate of the escorts to the king’s house. Then he sat on the throne of the kings. | So all the people of the land rejoiced; and the city was quiet, for they had slain Athaliah with the sword in the king’s house. | Jehoash was seven years old when he became king.",

      "ChapterText": "When Athaliah, the mother of King Ahaziah of Judah, learned that her son was dead, she began to destroy the rest of the royal family. | But Ahaziah’s sister Jehosheba, the daughter of King Jehoram, took Ahaziah’s infant son, Joash, and stole him away from among the rest of the king’s children, who were about to be killed. She put Joash and his nurse in a bedroom, and they hid him from Athaliah, so the child was not murdered. | Joash remained hidden in the Temple of the Lord for six years while Athaliah ruled over the land. | In the seventh year of Athaliah’s reign, Jehoiada the priest summoned the commanders, the Carite mercenaries, and the palace guards to come to the Temple of the Lord. He made a solemn pact with them and made them swear an oath of loyalty there in the Lord’s Temple; then he showed them the king’s son. | Jehoiada told them, “This is what you must do. A third of you who are on duty on the Sabbath are to guard the royal palace itself. | Another third of you are to stand guard at the Sur Gate, and the final third must stand guard behind the palace guard as a protection for the palace. | The other two groups who are off duty on the Sabbath must stand guard for the king at the Lord’s Temple. | Form a bodyguard around the king and keep your weapons in hand. Kill anyone who tries to break through. Stay with the king wherever he goes.” | So the commanders did everything Jehoiada the priest ordered. The commanders took their men—those who were on duty that Sabbath and those who were off duty and brought them to Jehoiada the priest. | And Jehoiada supplied the commanders with the spears and small shields that had once belonged to King David and were stored in the Temple of the Lord. | The palace guards stationed themselves around the king with their weapons ready. They formed a line from the south side of the Temple around to the north side and all around the altar. | Then Jehoiada brought out Joash, the king’s son, placed the crown on his head, and presented him with a copy of God’s laws. They anointed him and proclaimed him king, and everyone clapped their hands and shouted, “Long live the king!” | When Athaliah heard the noise made by the palace guards and the people, she hurried to the Lord’s Temple to see what was happening. | When she arrived, she saw the newly crowned king standing in his place of authority by the pillar, as was the custom at times of coronation. The commanders and trumpeters were surrounding him, and people from all over the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. Athaliah tore her clothes and shouted, “Treason! Treason!” | Then Jehoiada the priest ordered the commanders who were in charge of the troops, “Take her to the soldiers in front of the Temple, and kill anyone who tries to rescue her.” For the priest had said, “She must not be killed in the Temple of the Lord.” | So they seized her and led her out to the gate where horses enter the palace grounds, and she was killed there. | Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the Lord and the king and the people that they would be the Lord’s people. He also made a covenant between the king and the people. | Then all the people of the land went over to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They demolished the altars and smashed the idols to pieces, and they killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front of the altars. Jehoiada the priest stationed guards at the Temple of the Lord. | Then the commanders, the Carite mercenaries, the palace guards, and all the people of the land escorted the king from the Temple of the Lord. They went through the gate of the guards and into the palace, and the king took his seat on the royal throne. | So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was peaceful because Athaliah had been killed at the king’s palace. | Joash was seven years old when he became king.",

So he was hidden from Athaliah and was not killed. | Joash was in hiding with her in the Lord’s temple six years while Athaliah reigned over the land. | In the seventh year, Jehoiada sent for the commanders of hundreds, the Carites, and the guards.

They each brought their men—those coming on duty on the Sabbath and those going off duty—and came to the priest Jehoiada. | The priest gave to the commanders of hundreds King David’s spears and shields that were in the Lord’s temple. | Then the guards stood with their weapons in hand surrounding the king—from the right side of the temple to the left side, by the altar and by the temple. | They brought out the king’s son, put the crown on him, gave him the testimony, and made him king.

      "ChapterText": "Cuando Atalía, la madre de Ocozías, vio que su hijo había muerto, se levantó y mandó matar a toda la familia real. Pero Josaba, hija del rey Joram y hermana de Ocozías, tomó a Joás, hijo de Ocozías, y lo sacó a escondidas de entre los hijos del rey que estaban siendo ejecutados, y lo escondió junto con su nodriza en una habitación. Así lo ocultaron de Atalía y no lo mataron. Joás estuvo escondido con ella durante seis años en la casa del SEÑOR, mientras Atalía reinaba sobre el país.\n\nPero en el séptimo año, Joiada mandó llamar a los jefes de los caritas y de la guardia, y los hizo venir a él a la casa del SEÑOR. Allí hizo un pacto con ellos, los hizo jurar en la casa del SEÑOR y les mostró al hijo del rey. Luego les ordenó: “Esto es lo que deben hacer: una tercera parte de ustedes, los que salen de turno el sábado y custodian la casa del rey, otra tercera parte estará en la puerta Sur y la otra tercera parte en la puerta detrás de la guardia; así protegerán el palacio. Las otras dos divisiones, que entran de servicio el sábado para custodiar la casa del SEÑOR en favor del rey, rodearán al rey, cada uno con sus armas en la mano. Cualquiera que se acerque a las filas será muerto. Estén con el rey cuando salga y cuando entre”.\n\nLos jefes hicieron todo lo que el sacerdote Joiada les mandó, y cada uno llevó a sus hombres, tanto los que salían de turno el sábado como los que entraban, y fueron con el sacerdote Joiada. El sacerdote entregó a los jefes las lanzas y los escudos que habían sido del rey David y que estaban en la casa del SEÑOR. Los guardias se colocaron, cada uno con sus armas en la mano, desde el lado sur hasta el lado norte de la casa, junto al altar y alrededor de la casa, para proteger al rey.\n\nEntonces Joiada sacó al hijo del rey, le puso la corona y le entregó el testimonio. Lo proclamaron rey, lo ungieron, aplaudieron y gritaron: “¡Viva el rey!”\n\nCuando Atalía oyó el alboroto de la guardia y del pueblo, fue a la casa del SEÑOR donde estaba la gente. Al mirar, vio al rey de pie junto a la columna, como era la costumbre, y a los jefes y trompetistas junto al rey, y a todo el pueblo del país celebrando y tocando trompetas. Atalía rasgó sus vestidos y gritó: “¡Traición! ¡Traición!”\n\nEntonces el sacerdote Joiada ordenó a los jefes que estaban al mando del ejército: “Sáquenla de entre las filas y maten a espada a cualquiera que la siga”. Porque el sacerdote había dicho: “No la maten en la casa del SEÑOR”. Así que la apresaron y, cuando llegó a la entrada de los caballos en el palacio del rey, allí la mataron.\n\nJoiada hizo un pacto entre el SEÑOR, el rey y el pueblo, para que fueran el pueblo del SEÑOR, y también entre el rey y el pueblo. Luego toda la gente del país fue al templo de Baal y lo derribaron; rompieron en pedazos sus altares e imágenes, y mataron a Matán, sacerdote de Baal, delante de los altares. El sacerdote puso guardias en la casa del SEÑOR.\n\nDespués Joiada tomó a los jefes, a los caritas, a la guardia y a toda la gente del país, y bajaron al rey desde la casa del SEÑOR, entrando por la puerta de la guardia al palacio del rey. Y el rey se sentó en el trono real. Todo el pueblo del país se alegró y la ciudad quedó tranquila después de que Atalía fue muerta a espada en el palacio del rey.\n\nJoás tenía siete años cuando comenzó a reinar.",

      "ChapterText": "Cuando Atalía, la madre de Ocozías, vio que su hijo había muerto, empezó a matar a toda la familia real. Pero Josaba, hija del rey Joram y hermana de Ocozías, tomó a Joás, el hijo de Ocozías, y lo sacó a escondidas, junto con su nodriza, del dormitorio donde estaban a punto de matar a los príncipes. Lo escondió de Atalía, y así Joás no murió.\n\nDurante seis años estuvo escondido en el templo del SEÑOR, mientras Atalía gobernaba el país. Pero en el séptimo año, Joiada mandó llamar a los capitanes de los carios y de la guardia. Los hizo venir al templo del SEÑOR, les hizo jurar lealtad y luego les mostró al hijo del rey.\n\nLes dio estas instrucciones: “Esto es lo que deben hacer: un tercio de ustedes, los que entren de guardia el sábado, vigilarán el palacio del rey; otro tercio estará en la puerta Sur, y el último tercio en la puerta detrás de la guardia. Las dos compañías que salgan de turno esa semana deberán custodiar el templo del SEÑOR para proteger al rey. Rodeen al rey, cada uno con su arma en la mano, y si alguien intenta acercarse al grupo, mátenlo; permanezcan junto al rey, pase lo que pase.”\n\nLos capitanes hicieron exactamente lo que el sacerdote Joiada les ordenó. Cada uno con sus hombres, tanto los que entraban de guardia el sábado como los que salían, se presentaron ante el sacerdote Joiada. Él les entregó las lanzas y los escudos del rey David, que estaban en el templo del SEÑOR. Y los guardias, con las armas en la mano, se colocaron desde el extremo sur hasta el extremo norte del recinto, rodeando el altar y el templo para proteger al rey.\n\nEntonces Joiada sacó al hijo del rey, le puso la corona y las insignias reales. Lo proclamaron rey y lo ungieron, aplaudiendo y gritando: “¡Viva el rey!”\n\nAtalía oyó el alboroto del pueblo y fue al templo del SEÑOR donde estaba la multitud. Cuando vio al rey de pie junto a la columna, como era costumbre, y a los capitanes y trompeteros junto a él, y a todo el pueblo celebrando y tocando trompetas, rasgó sus vestiduras y gritó: “¡Traición, traición!”\n\nEntonces el sacerdote Joiada ordenó a los capitanes que estaban al mando del ejército: “Sáquenla fuera, entre las filas. Y si alguien la sigue, mátenlo a filo de espada.” Había dado la orden de que no la mataran en el templo del SEÑOR. Así que la sacaron a la fuerza hasta la puerta de los caballos del palacio real, y allí la mataron.\n\nDespués Joiada hizo un pacto entre el SEÑOR, el rey y el pueblo, para que fueran el pueblo del SEÑOR; y también hizo un pacto entre el rey y el pueblo. Entonces toda la gente fue al templo de Baal y lo destruyó. Rompieron completamente sus altares e imágenes, y mataron a Matán, el sacerdote de Baal, delante de los altares. Luego Joiada puso guardias para el templo del SEÑOR.\n\nCon los capitanes, los carios, la guardia y todo el pueblo, Joiada llevó al rey desde el templo del SEÑOR, pasando por la puerta de la guardia, hasta el palacio, donde Joás se sentó en el trono real. Todo el pueblo se alegró y la ciudad quedó tranquila, porque Atalía había sido muerta a filo de espada en el palacio real.",

      "ChapterText": "Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them. | And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers. | And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the LORD their God. | Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto the LORD their God. | Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise. | Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee. | Thou art the LORD the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham; | And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous: | And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red sea; | And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as it is this day. | And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters. | Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go. | Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments: | And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant: | And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them. | But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments, | And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not. | Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations; | Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go. | Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst. | Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not. | Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan. | Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it. | So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would. | And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness. | Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations. | Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies. | But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the land of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies; | And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear. | Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands. | Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God. | Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day. | Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly: | Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them. | For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works. | Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it: | And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress. | And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, Levites, and priests, seal unto it.",

They stood in their places and confessed their sins and the wickedness of their fathers. | They stood where they were and read from the Book of the Law of the LORD their God for a quarter of the day, and spent another quarter in confession and in worshiping the LORD their God. | Standing on the stairs were the Levites-Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani and Kenani-who called with loud voices to the LORD their God. | And the Levites-Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah and Pethahiah-said: \"Stand up and praise the LORD your God, who is from everlasting to everlasting. Blessed be your glorious name, and may it be exalted above all blessing and praise. | You alone are the LORD.

You have kept your promise because you are righteous. | \"You saw the suffering of our forefathers in Egypt; you heard their cry at the Red Sea. | You sent miraculous signs and wonders against Pharaoh, against all his officials and all the people of his land, for you knew how arrogantly the Egyptians treated them. You made a name for yourself, which remains to this day. | You divided the sea before them, so that they passed through it on dry ground, but you hurled their pursuers into the depths, like a stone into mighty waters. | By day you led them with a pillar of cloud, and by night with a pillar of fire to give them light on the way they were to take. | \"You came down on Mount Sinai; you spoke to them from heaven. You gave them regulations and laws that are just and right, and decrees and commands that are good. | You made known to them your holy Sabbath and gave them commands, decrees and laws through your servant Moses. | In their hunger you gave them bread from heaven and in their thirst you brought them water from the rock; you told them to go in and take possession of the land you had sworn with uplifted hand to give them. | \"But they, our forefathers, became arrogant and stiff-necked, and did not obey your commands. | They refused to listen and failed to remember the miracles you performed among them. They became stiff-necked and in their rebellion appointed a leader in order to return to their slavery. But you are a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love. Therefore you did not desert them, | even when they cast for themselves an image of a calf and said, 'This is your god, who brought you up out of Egypt,' or when they committed awful blasphemies. | \"Because of your great compassion you did not abandon them in the desert. By day the pillar of cloud did not cease to guide them on their path, nor the pillar of fire by night to shine on the way they were to take. | You gave your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold your manna from their mouths, and you gave them water for their thirst. | For forty years you sustained them in the desert; they lacked nothing, their clothes did not wear out nor did their feet become swollen. | \"You gave them kingdoms and nations, allotting to them even the remotest frontiers. They took over the country of Sihon king of Heshbon and the country of Og king of Bashan. | You made their sons as numerous as the stars in the sky, and you brought them into the land that you told their fathers to enter and possess. | Their sons went in and took possession of the land. You subdued before them the Canaanites, who lived in the land; you handed the Canaanites over to them, along with their kings and the peoples of the land, to deal with them as they pleased. | They captured fortified cities and fertile land; they took possession of houses filled with all kinds of good things, wells already dug, vineyards, olive groves and fruit trees in abundance. They ate to the full and were well-nourished; they reveled in your great goodness. | \"But they were disobedient and rebelled against you; they put your law behind their backs. They killed your prophets, who had admonished them in order to turn them back to you; they committed awful blasphemies. | So you handed them over to their enemies, who oppressed them. But when they were oppressed they cried out to you. From heaven you heard them, and in your great compassion you gave them deliverers, who rescued them from the hand of their enemies. | \"But as soon as they were at rest, they again did what was evil in your sight. Then you abandoned them to the hand of their enemies so that they ruled over them. And when they cried out to you again, you heard from heaven, and in your compassion you delivered them time after time. | \"You warned them to return to your law, but they became arrogant and disobeyed your commands. They sinned against your ordinances, by which a man will live if he obeys them. Stubbornly they turned their backs on you, became stiff-necked and refused to listen. | For many years you were patient with them. By your Spirit you admonished them through your prophets. Yet they paid no attention, so you handed them over to the neighboring peoples. | But in your great mercy you did not put an end to them or abandon them, for you are a gracious and merciful God. | \"Now therefore, O our God, the great, mighty and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love, do not let all this hardship seem trifling in your eyes-the hardship that has come upon us, upon our kings and leaders, upon our priests and prophets, upon our fathers and all your people, from the days of the kings of Assyria until today. | In all that has happened to us, you have been just; you have acted faithfully, while we did wrong. | Our kings, our leaders, our priests and our fathers did not follow your law; they did not pay attention to your commands or the warnings you gave them. | Even while they were in their kingdom, enjoying your great goodness to them in the spacious and fertile land you gave them, they did not serve you or turn from their evil ways. | \"But see, we are slaves today, slaves in the land you gave our forefathers so they could eat its fruit and the other good things it produces. | Because of our sins, its abundant harvest goes to the kings you have placed over us. They rule over our bodies and our cattle as they please. We are in great distress. | \"In view of all this, we are making a binding agreement, putting it in writing, and our leaders, our Levites and our priests are affixing their seals to it.\"",

Yet when they turned and cried to you, you heard from heaven, and many times you delivered them according to your mercies. | And you warned them in order to turn them back to your law. Yet they acted presumptuously and did not obey your commandments, but sinned against your rules, which if a person does them, he shall live by them, and turned a stubborn shoulder and stiffened their neck and would not obey. | Many years you bore with them and warned them by your Spirit through your prophets. Yet they would not give ear. Therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands. | Nevertheless, in your great mercies you did not make an end of them or forsake them, for you are a gracious and merciful God. | \"Now, therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and steadfast love, let not all the hardship seem little to you that has come upon us, upon our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, our fathers, and all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria until this day. | Yet you have been righteous in all that has come upon us, for you have dealt faithfully and we have acted wickedly. | Our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers have not kept your law or paid attention to your commandments and your warnings that you gave them. | Even in their own kingdom, enjoying your great goodness that you gave them, and in the large and rich land that you set before them, they did not serve you or turn from their wicked works. | Behold, we are slaves this day; in the land that you gave to our fathers to enjoy its fruit and its good gifts, behold, we are slaves. | And its rich yield goes to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins. They rule over our bodies and over our livestock as they please, and we are in great distress. | \"Because of all this we make a firm covenant in writing; on the sealed document are the names of our princes, our Levites, and our priests.\"",

      "ChapterText": "On the twenty-fourth day of this month, the Israelites gathered together fasting and in sackcloth, their heads covered with dust. | Those of Israelite descent separated themselves from all who were of foreign extraction, then stood forward and confessed their sins and the guilty deeds of their fathers. | When they had taken their places, they read from the book of the law of the LORD their God, for a fourth part of the day, and during another fourth part they made their confession and prostrated themselves before the LORD their God. | Standing on the platform of the Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, who cried out to the LORD their God, with a loud voice. | The Levites Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah said, \"Arise, bless the LORD, your God, from eternity to eternity!\" The Israelites answered with the blessing, \"Blessed is your glorious name, and exalted above all blessing and praise.\" | Then Ezra said: \"It is you, O LORD, you are the only one; you made the heavens, the highest heavens and all their host, the earth and all that is upon it, the seas and all that is in them. To all of them you give life, and the heavenly hosts bow down before you. | \"You, O LORD, are the God who chose Abram, who brought him out from Ur of the Chaldees, and named him Abraham. | When you had found his heart faithful in your sight, you made the covenant with him to give to him and his posterity the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Jebusites, and Girgashites. These promises of yours you fulfilled, for you are just. | \"You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, you heard their cry by the Red Sea; | You worked signs and wonders against Pharaoh, against all his servants and the people of his land, Because you knew of their insolence toward them; thus you made for yourself a name even to this day. | The sea you divided before them, on dry ground they passed through the midst of the sea; Their pursuers you hurled into the depths, like a stone into the mighty waters. | With a column of cloud you led them by day, and by night with a column of fire, To light the way of their journey, the way in which they must travel. | On Mount Sinai you came down, you spoke with them from heaven; You gave them just ordinances, firm laws, good statutes, and commandments; | Your holy sabbath you made known to them, commandments, statutes, and law you prescribed for them, by the hand of Moses your servant. | Food from heaven you gave them in their hunger, water from a rock you sent them in their thirst. You bade them enter and occupy the land which you had sworn with upraised hand to give them. | \"But they, our fathers, proved to be insolent; they held their necks stiff and would not obey your commandments. | They refused to obey and no longer remembered the miracles you had worked for them. They stiffened their necks and turned their heads to return to their slavery in Egypt. But you are a God of pardons, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in mercy; you did not forsake them. | Though they made for themselves a molten calf, and proclaimed, 'Here is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,' and were guilty of great effronteries, | yet in your great mercy you did not forsake them in the desert. The column of cloud did not cease to lead them by day on their journey, nor did the column of fire by night cease to light for them the way by which they were to travel. | \"Your good spirit you bestowed on them, to give them understanding; your manna you did not withhold from their mouths, and you gave them water in their thirst. | Forty years in the desert you sustained them: they did not want; their garments did not become worn, and their feet did not become swollen. | You gave them kingdoms and peoples, which you divided up among them as border lands. They possessed the land of Sihon, king of Heshbon, and the land of Og, king of Bashan. | \"You made their children as numerous as the stars of the heavens, and you brought them into the land which you had commanded their fathers to enter and possess. | The sons went in to take possession of the land, and you humbled before them the Canaanite inhabitants of the land and delivered them over into their power, their kings as well as the peoples of the land, to do with them as they would. | They captured fortified cities and fertile land; they took possession of houses filled with all good things, cisterns already dug, vineyards, olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance. They could eat and have their fill, fatten and feast themselves on your immense good gifts. | \"But they were contemptuous and rebellious: they cast your law behind their backs, they slew your prophets who bore witness against them in order to bring them back to you, and they were guilty of great effronteries. | Therefore you delivered them into the power of their enemies, who oppressed them. But in the time of their oppression they would cry out to you, and you would hear them from heaven, and according to your great mercy give them saviors to deliver them from the power of their enemies. | \"As soon as they had relief, they would go back to doing evil in your sight. Then again you abandoned them to the power of their enemies, who crushed them. Then they cried out to you, and you heard them from heaven and delivered them according to your mercy, many times over. | You bore witness against them, in order to bring them back to your law. But they were insolent and would not obey your commandments; they sinned against your ordinances, from which men draw life when they practice them. They turned stubborn backs, stiffened their necks, and would not obey. | You were patient with them for many years, bearing witness against them through your spirit, by means of your prophets; still they would not listen. Thus you delivered them over into the power of the peoples of the lands. | Yet in your great mercy you did not completely destroy them and you did not forsake them, for you are a kind and merciful God. | \"Now, therefore, O our God, great, mighty, and awesome God, you who in your mercy preserve the covenant, take into account all the disasters that have befallen us, our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, our fathers, and your entire people, from the time of the kings of Assyria until this day! | In all that has come upon us you have been just, for you kept faith while we have done evil. | Yes, our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers have not kept your law; they paid no attention to your commandments and the obligations of which you reminded them. | While they were yet in their kingdom, in the midst of the many good things that you had given them and in the wide and fertile land that you had spread out before them, they did not serve you nor did they turn away from their evil deeds. | But, see, we today are slaves; and as for the land which you gave our fathers that they might eat its fruits and good things-- see, we have become slaves upon it! | Its rich produce goes to the kings whom you set over us because of our sins, who rule over our bodies and our cattle as they please. We are in great distress!\"",

      "ChapterText": "El día veinticuatro de este mes, los hijos de Israel se reunieron para ayunar, vestidos de tela áspera y con tierra sobre la cabeza. Los descendientes de Israel se separaron de todos los extranjeros, se pusieron de pie y confesaron sus pecados y las maldades de sus padres. De pie en su lugar, leyeron el libro de la ley del Señor su Dios durante una cuarta parte del día; y durante otra cuarta parte confesaron sus pecados y adoraron al Señor su Dios.\n\nLuego, sobre la plataforma de los levitas, se pusieron de pie Jesúa, Baní, Cadmiel, Sebanías, Buní, Serebías, Baní y Quenaní, y clamaron en voz alta al Señor su Dios. Entonces los levitas Jesúa, Cadmiel, Baní, Hasabnías, Serebías, Hodías, Sebanías y Petahías dijeron: “Pónganse de pie y bendigan al Señor su Dios por siempre y para siempre. Bendito sea tu glorioso nombre, que está por encima de toda bendición y alabanza.\n\nTú solo eres el Señor; tú hiciste los cielos, los cielos de los cielos y todo su ejército, la tierra y todo lo que hay en ella, los mares y todo lo que contienen. Tú cuidas de todo eso, y el ejército del cielo te adora. Tú eres el Señor Dios, que escogiste a Abram, lo sacaste de Ur de los caldeos y le diste el nombre de Abraham. Hallaste fiel su corazón delante de ti, e hiciste un pacto con él para darle la tierra de los cananeos, hititas, amorreos, ferezeos, jebuseos y gergeseos, para dársela a su descendencia. Cumpliste tu palabra, porque eres justo.\n\nViste la aflicción de nuestros padres en Egipto y escuchaste su clamor junto al Mar Rojo. Hiciste señales y maravillas contra el faraón, contra todos sus siervos y contra la gente de su tierra, porque sabías que actuaban con arrogancia contra ellos. Así te hiciste un nombre, como sucede hasta hoy. Dividiste el mar delante de ellos, y pasaron por en medio del mar en seco; pero a sus perseguidores los arrojaste a las profundidades, como una piedra en aguas poderosas.\n\nDurante el día los guiaste con una columna de nube, y durante la noche con una columna de fuego, para alumbrarles el camino por donde debían ir. Bajaste al monte Sinaí, les hablaste desde el cielo y les diste juicios rectos, leyes verdaderas, estatutos y mandamientos buenos. Les diste a conocer tu santo sábado y les diste mandamientos, estatutos y leyes por medio de Moisés, tu siervo. Les diste pan del cielo para su hambre y sacaste agua de la roca para su sed. Les prometiste que entrarían a poseer la tierra que habías jurado darles.\n\nPero ellos y nuestros padres actuaron con soberbia, endurecieron su cerviz y no obedecieron tus mandamientos. Se negaron a obedecer y no recordaron las maravillas que hiciste entre ellos. Endurecieron su cerviz y, en su rebeldía, nombraron un jefe para regresar a su esclavitud. Pero tú eres un Dios dispuesto a perdonar, clemente y compasivo, lento para la ira y grande en misericordia, y no los abandonaste.\n\nIncluso cuando se hicieron un becerro de metal fundido y dijeron: ‘Este es tu dios que te sacó de Egipto’, y cometieron grandes ofensas, tú, por tu gran misericordia, no los abandonaste en el desierto. La columna de nube no se apartó de ellos de día para guiarlos por el camino, ni la columna de fuego de noche para alumbrarles el camino por donde debían ir. Les diste tu buen espíritu para instruirlos, no les negaste tu maná y les diste agua para su sed.\n\nDurante cuarenta años los sustentaste en el desierto; no les faltó nada, su ropa no se gastó ni se les hincharon los pies. Les diste reinos y naciones, y los repartiste por distritos; así poseyeron la tierra de Sijón, rey de Hesbón, y la tierra de Og, rey de Basán. Multiplicaste a sus hijos como las estrellas del cielo y los llevaste a la tierra que habías prometido a sus padres que poseerían.\n\nEntraron los hijos y poseyeron la tierra; sometiste ante ellos a los habitantes de la tierra, los cananeos, y los entregaste en sus manos, junto con sus reyes y los pueblos de la tierra, para que hicieran con ellos lo que quisieran. Tomaron ciudades fortificadas y una tierra fértil, casas llenas de toda clase de bienes, pozos ya cavados, viñedos, olivares y árboles frutales en abundancia. Comieron, se saciaron, engordaron y se deleitaron en tu gran bondad.\n\nPero fueron desobedientes, se rebelaron contra ti, echaron tu ley a sus espaldas, mataron a tus profetas que les amonestaban para hacerlos volver a ti, y cometieron grandes ofensas. Por eso los entregaste en manos de sus enemigos, que los oprimieron. Pero en el tiempo de su angustia, cuando clamaron a ti, tú los escuchaste desde el cielo y, por tu gran misericordia, les diste libertadores que los salvaron de manos de sus enemigos.\n\nPero cuando tenían descanso, volvían a hacer lo malo delante de ti; por eso los dejaste en manos de sus enemigos, para que los dominaran. Sin embargo, cuando se volvían y clamaban a ti, tú los escuchabas desde el cielo y muchas veces los libraste por tu misericordia. Les advertiste para hacerlos volver a tu ley, pero ellos actuaron con soberbia y no obedecieron tus mandamientos, sino que pecaron contra tus juicios (que si el hombre los cumple, vivirá por ellos), te dieron la espalda, endurecieron su cerviz y no quisieron escuchar.\n\nSin embargo, por muchos años tuviste paciencia con ellos y les advertiste por tu espíritu a través de tus profetas, pero no quisieron escuchar. Por eso los entregaste en manos de los pueblos de otras tierras. Pero por tu gran misericordia no los destruiste ni los abandonaste, porque eres un Dios clemente y compasivo.\n\nAhora pues, Dios nuestro, grande, poderoso y temible, que cumples el pacto y la misericordia, no consideres poca toda la aflicción que ha venido sobre nosotros, sobre nuestros reyes, príncipes, sacerdotes, profetas, padres y sobre todo tu pueblo, desde los días de los reyes de Asiria hasta hoy. Pero tú eres justo en todo lo que nos ha sucedido, porque tú has obrado con fidelidad, pero nosotros hemos hecho lo malo.\n\nNi nuestros reyes, príncipes, sacerdotes ni nuestros padres han guardado tu ley ni han obedecido tus mandamientos y testimonios con los que les advertiste. No te sirvieron en su reino, ni en tu gran bondad que les diste, ni en la tierra espaciosa y fértil que pusiste delante de ellos, ni se apartaron de sus malas obras.\n\nMira, hoy somos siervos; y en la tierra que diste a nuestros padres para que comieran de su fruto y de su bien, aquí somos siervos. Sus abundantes cosechas son para los reyes que has puesto sobre nosotros por causa de nuestros pecados; ellos dominan sobre nuestros cuerpos y sobre nuestro ganado como quieren, y estamos en gran angustia.\n\nPor todo esto, hacemos un pacto firme y lo ponemos por escrito; y nuestros príncipes, levitas y sacerdotes lo sellan.",

Comieron, se saciaron, engordaron y se deleitaron en tu gran bondad.\n\nSin embargo, desobedecieron y se rebelaron contra ti, echaron tu ley a sus espaldas y mataron a tus profetas, que les advertían para hacerlos volver a ti, y cometieron grandes blasfemias. Por eso los entregaste en manos de sus enemigos, que los oprimieron. Pero en su angustia clamaron a ti, y tú los escuchaste desde el cielo; y por tu gran misericordia les diste libertadores que los salvaron de manos de sus enemigos.\n\nPero cuando tenían descanso, volvían a hacer lo malo delante de ti, y los abandonabas en manos de sus enemigos, que los dominaban. Sin embargo, cuando se volvían y clamaban a ti, tú los escuchabas desde el cielo, y muchas veces los libraste por tu misericordia. Les advertiste para hacerlos volver a tu ley, pero ellos actuaron con soberbia y no obedecieron tus mandamientos, sino que pecaron contra tus normas, que dan vida a quien las cumple. Endurecieron su cerviz, se obstinaron y no quisieron obedecer.\n\nPor muchos años tuviste paciencia con ellos y les advertiste por tu Espíritu a través de tus profetas, pero no quisieron escuchar. Por eso los entregaste en manos de los pueblos de otras tierras. Sin embargo, por tu gran misericordia no los exterminaste ni los abandonaste, porque eres un Dios clemente y compasivo.\n\nAhora pues, Dios nuestro, grande, poderoso y temible, que cumples el pacto y eres fiel en tu amor, no consideres poca la aflicción que ha venido sobre nosotros, sobre nuestros reyes, príncipes, sacerdotes, profetas, padres y sobre todo tu pueblo, desde los días de los reyes de Asiria hasta hoy. Pero tú eres justo en todo lo que nos ha sucedido, porque tú has actuado fielmente y nosotros hemos hecho lo malo.\n\nNuestros reyes, príncipes, sacerdotes y padres no cumplieron tu ley ni prestaron atención a tus mandamientos ni a las advertencias que les diste. Incluso en su propio reino, disfrutando de tu gran bondad que les diste, y en la tierra espaciosa y fértil que pusiste delante de ellos, no te sirvieron ni se apartaron de sus malas obras.\n\nMira, hoy somos esclavos; en la tierra que diste a nuestros padres para que comieran de su fruto y de sus bienes, aquí somos esclavos. Sus abundantes cosechas van a los reyes que has puesto sobre nosotros por causa de nuestros pecados. Ellos dominan sobre nuestros cuerpos y sobre nuestro ganado como quieren, y estamos en gran angustia.\n\nPor todo esto, hacemos un pacto firme y lo ponemos por escrito; en el documento sellado están los nombres de nuestros príncipes, levitas y sacerdotes.",

      "ChapterText": "El día veinticuatro de este mes, los israelitas se reunieron ayunando, vestidos de saco y con la cabeza cubierta de polvo. | Los descendientes de Israel se separaron de todos los extranjeros, se pusieron de pie y confesaron sus pecados y las culpas de sus padres. | Cuando tomaron sus lugares, leyeron el libro de la ley del SEÑOR su Dios durante una cuarta parte del día, y durante otra cuarta parte confesaron sus pecados y se postraron ante el SEÑOR su Dios. | De pie sobre la plataforma de los levitas estaban Jesúa, Binui, Cadmiel, Sebanías, Buni, Serebías, Bani y Quenaní, quienes clamaron en voz alta al SEÑOR su Dios. | Los levitas Jesúa, Cadmiel, Bani, Hasabneías, Serebías, Hodías, Sebanías y Petahías dijeron: \"¡Levántense, bendigan al SEÑOR su Dios desde la eternidad y hasta la eternidad!\" Y los israelitas respondieron con la bendición: \"Bendito sea tu glorioso nombre, que está por encima de toda bendición y alabanza.\" | Entonces Esdras dijo: \"Tú eres, SEÑOR, sólo tú; tú hiciste los cielos, los cielos más altos y todo su ejército, la tierra y todo lo que hay en ella, los mares y todo lo que contienen. A todos les das vida, y el ejército del cielo se postra ante ti. | \"Tú, SEÑOR, eres el Dios que escogió a Abram, lo sacaste de Ur de los caldeos y le diste el nombre de Abraham. | Cuando hallaste fiel su corazón delante de ti, hiciste un pacto con él para dar a él y a su descendencia la tierra de los cananeos, hititas, amorreos, ferezeos, jebuseos y gergeseos. Cumpliste tus promesas, porque eres justo. | \"Viste la aflicción de nuestros padres en Egipto, escuchaste su clamor junto al Mar Rojo; | Hiciste señales y maravillas contra el faraón, contra todos sus siervos y el pueblo de su tierra, porque sabías de su arrogancia contra ellos; así te hiciste un nombre que dura hasta hoy. | Dividiste el mar delante de ellos, y pasaron por en medio del mar en seco; a sus perseguidores los arrojaste a las profundidades, como una piedra en aguas poderosas. | Con una columna de nube los guiaste de día, y de noche con una columna de fuego, para alumbrarles el camino por donde debían ir. | En el monte Sinaí descendiste, les hablaste desde el cielo; les diste normas justas, leyes firmes, estatutos y mandamientos buenos; | Les diste a conocer tu santo sábado, les prescribiste mandamientos, estatutos y ley por medio de Moisés, tu siervo. | Les diste pan del cielo cuando tuvieron hambre, y agua de la roca cuando tuvieron sed. Les ordenaste entrar y poseer la tierra que habías jurado darles con mano alzada. | \"Pero ellos, nuestros padres, se volvieron arrogantes; endurecieron su cerviz y no obedecieron tus mandamientos. | Se negaron a obedecer y se olvidaron de las maravillas que habías hecho por ellos. Endurecieron su cerviz y decidieron volver a su esclavitud en Egipto. Pero tú eres un Dios que perdona, lleno de gracia y compasión, lento para la ira y grande en misericordia; no los abandonaste. | Aunque se hicieron un becerro de metal fundido y proclamaron: 'Este es tu dios que te sacó de Egipto', y cometieron grandes ofensas, | aun así, por tu gran misericordia, no los abandonaste en el desierto. La columna de nube no dejó de guiarlos de día en su camino, ni la columna de fuego de noche dejó de alumbrarles el camino por donde debían ir. | \"Tu buen espíritu les diste para darles entendimiento; no les negaste tu maná, y les diste agua cuando tuvieron sed. | Durante cuarenta años los sustentaste en el desierto: nada les faltó; sus ropas no se gastaron ni se hincharon sus pies. | Les diste reinos y pueblos, que repartiste entre ellos como territorios. Poseyeron la tierra de Sihón, rey de Hesbón, y la tierra de Og, rey de Basán. | \"Multiplicaste a sus hijos como las estrellas del cielo, y los llevaste a la tierra que habías prometido a sus padres que entrarían a poseer. | Los hijos entraron y tomaron posesión de la tierra, y humillaste ante ellos a los cananeos que habitaban en ella, entregándolos en su poder, junto con sus reyes y los pueblos de la tierra, para que hicieran con ellos lo que quisieran. | Tomaron ciudades fortificadas y tierras fértiles; se adueñaron de casas llenas de toda clase de bienes, cisternas ya cavadas, viñedos, olivares y árboles frutales en abundancia. Comieron hasta saciarse, engordaron y se deleitaron con tu inmensa bondad. | \"Pero fueron desobedientes y rebeldes: echaron tu ley a sus espaldas, mataron a tus profetas que les amonestaban para hacerlos volver a ti, y cometieron grandes ofensas. | Por eso los entregaste en manos de sus enemigos, que los oprimieron. Pero en su aflicción clamaron a ti, y tú los escuchaste desde el cielo, y por tu gran misericordia les diste libertadores que los salvaran del poder de sus enemigos. | \"Pero apenas tenían alivio, volvían a hacer lo malo ante tus ojos. Entonces los abandonabas de nuevo al poder de sus enemigos, que los dominaban. Luego volvían a clamar a ti, y tú los escuchabas desde el cielo y los librabas según tu misericordia, muchas veces. | Les advertiste para hacerlos volver a tu ley. Pero ellos fueron arrogantes y no obedecieron tus mandamientos; pecaron contra tus ordenanzas, por las cuales el hombre vive si las cumple. Dieron la espalda obstinadamente, endurecieron su cerviz y no quisieron obedecer. | Tuviste paciencia con ellos durante muchos años, les advertiste por tu espíritu, por medio de tus profetas; pero no quisieron escuchar. Por eso los entregaste en manos de los pueblos de la tierra. | Pero por tu gran misericordia no los destruiste del todo ni los abandonaste, porque eres un Dios bondadoso y compasivo. | \"Ahora pues, Dios nuestro, Dios grande, poderoso y temible, tú que guardas el pacto y la misericordia, mira todas las calamidades que nos han sobrevenido, a nosotros, a nuestros reyes, a nuestros príncipes, a nuestros sacerdotes, a nuestros profetas, a nuestros padres y a todo tu pueblo, desde los días de los reyes de Asiria hasta hoy. | En todo lo que nos ha sucedido, tú has sido justo, porque tú has obrado fielmente, mientras que nosotros hemos hecho lo malo. | Nuestros reyes, príncipes, sacerdotes y padres no han guardado tu ley; no prestaron atención a tus mandamientos ni a las advertencias que les diste. | Mientras estaban en su reino, disfrutando de los muchos bienes que les diste y de la tierra espaciosa y fértil que pusiste delante de ellos, no te sirvieron ni se apartaron de sus malas obras. | Pero, mira, hoy somos esclavos; y la tierra que diste a nuestros padres para que comieran de sus frutos y de sus bienes, ¡aquí estamos, esclavos en ella! | Sus abundantes productos van a los reyes que pusiste sobre nosotros por causa de nuestros pecados, quienes dominan sobre nuestros cuerpos y nuestro ganado como quieren. ¡Estamos en gran angustia!\"",

Such people are inflated by empty notions of their unspiritual mind. | He doesn’t hold on to the head, from whom the whole body, nourished and held together by its ligaments and tendons, grows with growth from God. | If you died with Christ to the elements of this world, why do you live as if you still belonged to the world? Why do you submit to regulations: | “Don’t handle, don’t taste, don’t touch”? | All these regulations refer to what is destined to perish by being used up; they are human commands and doctrines. | Although these have a reputation for wisdom by promoting self-made religion, false humility, and severe treatment of the body, they are not of any value in curbing self-indulgence.",

Tengan cuidado de que nadie los engañe por medio de filosofías y huecas sutilezas, que se basan en tradiciones humanas y en los principios de este mundo, y no en Cristo. Porque en él habita corporalmente toda la plenitud de la divinidad, y ustedes están completos en él, que es la cabeza de todo principado y autoridad.\n\nEn él también fueron circuncidados, no con una circuncisión hecha por manos humanas, sino con la circuncisión que consiste en despojarse del cuerpo pecaminoso, es decir, la circuncisión que viene de Cristo. Ustedes fueron sepultados con él en el bautismo, y en él también resucitaron por la fe en el poder de Dios, que lo resucitó de entre los muertos. Antes, ustedes estaban muertos en sus pecados y en la incircuncisión de su carne, pero Dios les dio vida junto con Cristo, perdonándoles todos los pecados. Canceló la deuda que teníamos por los mandamientos y la eliminó clavándola en la cruz. Despojó a los poderes y autoridades, y los exhibió públicamente, triunfando sobre ellos en la cruz.\n\nPor eso, que nadie los juzgue por lo que comen o beben, o respecto a días de fiesta, luna nueva o días de reposo. Todo eso es solo una sombra de lo que ha de venir; la realidad es Cristo. Que nadie los prive de su premio, con falsas humildades y adoración de ángeles, metiéndose en cosas que no ha visto, hinchado sin motivo por su mente carnal. No se mantienen unidos a la cabeza, de la cual todo el cuerpo, sostenido y unido por las articulaciones y ligamentos, crece como Dios quiere.\n\nAsí que, si ustedes han muerto con Cristo a los principios de este mundo, ¿por qué, como si todavía pertenecieran al mundo, se someten a reglas como: “No toques esto”, “No pruebes aquello”, “No manejes lo otro”? Todas esas cosas están destinadas a desaparecer con el uso, porque son mandamientos y enseñanzas humanas. Tienen apariencia de sabiduría, con su religiosidad, falsa humildad y duro trato del cuerpo, pero no tienen valor alguno contra los deseos de la carne.",

I am working for those in Laodicea and for all those who have not met me. | I want their hearts to be made strong and to be joined together in love. I want them to know more and more about the full riches of complete understanding. Then they will know the mystery of God. That mystery is Christ. | All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in him. | But I tell you this so that no one can fool you by talking you into believing things that aren’t true. | So even though I am away from you in body, I am with you in spirit. I am glad because you are living in good order. I am happy because of how firm your faith in Christ is. | You received Christ Jesus as Lord. So keep on living your lives in him. | Have your roots in him. Build yourselves up in him. Grow strong in what you believe, just as you were taught. Be more thankful than ever before. | Make sure no one controls you. They will try to control you by using false reasoning that has no meaning. Their ideas depend on human teachings. They also depend on the basic spiritual powers of this world. They do not depend on Christ. | God’s whole nature is living in Christ in human form. | Because you belong to Christ, you have been made complete. He is the ruler over every power and authority. | When you received Christ, you were also circumcised by putting away your sinful nature. It was not a circumcision done by human hands. | When you were baptized, you were buried together with Christ. And you were raised to life together with him. You were raised to life by believing in God’s work. God himself raised Jesus from the dead. | At one time you were dead in your sins. Your desires controlled by sin were not yet cut away. But God gave you new life together with Christ. He forgave us all our sins. | He wiped out what the law said that we owed. The law stood against us. It judged us. But Jesus has taken it away and nailed it to the cross. | He won the battle over rulers and authorities. He made a public show of them. He won the battle over them by dying on the cross. | So don’t let anyone judge you because of what you eat or drink. Don’t let anyone judge you about holy days. Don’t let them judge you about the New Moon feast or Sabbath day. | These are only a shadow of the things to come. But what is real is found in Christ. | Some people enjoy pretending they aren’t proud. They worship angels. But don’t let people like that judge you. They tell you their sinful minds have seen visions. | They aren’t connected to the head. The head is Christ. The whole body depends on him. All the parts of the body are joined and held together. They grow strong as God causes them to grow. | Some people still follow the basic principles of the world. They think they have died with Christ. But why do they act as if they still belonged to the world? Why do they obey its rules? | Here are the rules. “Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!” | Rules like these are all going to die out as time goes by. They are only based on human rules and teachings. | It is true that these rules seem wise. But they don’t help people stop doing the evil things their sinful selves want to do.",

And with him you were raised to new life because you trusted the mighty power of God, who raised Christ from the dead. | You were dead because of your sins and because your sinful nature was not yet cut away. Then God made you alive with Christ, for he forgave all our sins. | He canceled the record of the charges against us and took it away by nailing it to the cross. | In this way, he disarmed the spiritual rulers and authorities. He shamed them publicly by his victory over them on the cross. | So don’t let anyone condemn you for what you eat or drink, or for not celebrating certain holy days or new moon ceremonies or Sabbaths. | For these rules are only shadows of the reality yet to come.

      "ChapterText": "The Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. So the Lord handed them over to Midian seven years, and they oppressed Israel. Because of Midian, the Israelites made hiding places for themselves in the mountains, caves, and strongholds. Whenever the Israelites planted crops, the Midianites, Amalekites, and the people of the east came and attacked them. They encamped against them and destroyed the produce of the land even as far as Gaza. They left nothing for Israel to eat, as well as no sheep, ox, or donkey. For the Midianites came with their cattle and their tents like a great swarm of locusts. They and their camels were without number, and they entered the land to lay waste to it. So Israel became poverty-stricken because of Midian, and the Israelites cried out to the Lord. When the Israelites cried out to him because of Midian, the Lord sent a prophet to them. He said to them, This is what the Lord God of Israel says: I brought you out of Egypt and out of the place of slavery. I rescued you from the power of Egypt and the power of all who oppressed you. I drove them out before you and gave you their land. I said to you: I am the Lord your God. Do not fear the gods of the Amorites whose land you live in. But you did not obey me. The angel of the Lord came, and he sat under the oak that was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite. His son Gideon was threshing wheat in the winepress in order to hide it from the Midianites. Then the angel of the Lord appeared to him and said, The Lord is with you, valiant warrior. Gideon said to him, Please, my lord, if the Lord is with us, why has all this happened? And where are all his wonders that our ancestors told us about? They said, Hasn’t the Lord brought us out of Egypt? But now the Lord has abandoned us and handed us over to Midian. The Lord turned to him and said, Go in the strength you have and deliver Israel from the grasp of Midian. I am sending you! He said to him, Please, Lord, how can I deliver Israel? Look, my family is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the youngest in my father’s family. But I will be with you, the Lord said to him. You will strike Midian down as if it were one man. Then he said to him, If I have found favor with you, give me a sign that you are speaking with me. Please do not leave this place until I return to you. Let me bring my gift and set it before you. And he said, I will stay until you return. So Gideon went and prepared a young goat and unleavened bread from a half bushel of flour. He placed the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot. He brought them out and offered them to him under the oak. The angel of God said to him, Take the meat with the unleavened bread, put it on this stone, and pour the broth on it. So he did that. The angel of the Lord extended the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened bread. Fire came up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread. Then the angel of the Lord vanished from his sight. When Gideon realized that he was the angel of the Lord, he said, Oh no, Lord God! I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face! But the Lord said to him, Peace to you. Don’t be afraid, for you will not die. So Gideon built an altar to the Lord there and called it The Lord Is Peace. It is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites today. On that very night the Lord said to him, Take your father’s young bull and a second bull seven years old. Then tear down the altar of Baal that belongs to your father and cut down the Asherah pole beside it. Build a well-constructed altar to the Lord your God on the top of this mound. Take the second bull and offer it as a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah pole you cut down. So Gideon took ten of his male servants and did as the Lord had told him. But because he was too afraid of his father’s family and the men of the city to do it in the daytime, he did it at night. When the men of the city got up in the morning, they found Baal’s altar torn down, the Asherah pole beside it cut down, and the second bull offered up on the altar that had been built. They said to each other, Who did this? After they made a thorough investigation, they said, Gideon son of Joash did it. Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out your son. He must die because he tore down Baal’s altar and cut down the Asherah pole beside it. But Joash said to all who stood against him, Would you plead Baal’s case for him? Would you save him? Whoever pleads his case will be put to death by morning! If he is a god, let him plead his case, because someone tore down his altar. That day, he was called Jerubbaal, since Joash said, Let Baal contend with him, because he tore down his altar. All the Midianites, Amalekites, and people of the east gathered together, crossed over the Jordan, and camped in the Jezreel Valley. The Spirit of the Lord enveloped Gideon, and he blew the ram’s horn and the Abiezrites rallied behind him. He sent messengers throughout all of Manasseh, who rallied behind him. He also sent messengers throughout Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, who also came to meet him. Then Gideon said to God, If you will deliver Israel by me, as you said, I will put a wool fleece here on the threshing floor. If dew is only on the fleece, and all the ground is dry, I will know that you will deliver Israel by me, as you said. And that is what happened. When he got up early in the morning, he squeezed the fleece and wrung dew out of it, filling a bowl with water. Gideon then said to God, Don’t be angry with me, let me speak one more time. Please allow me to make one more test with the fleece. Let it remain dry, and the dew be all over the ground. That night God did as Gideon requested: only the fleece was dry, and dew was all over the ground.",

      "ChapterText": "Los hijos de Israel hicieron lo malo ante los ojos del Señor, y el Señor los entregó en manos de los madianitas durante siete años. Los madianitas dominaron a Israel, y por culpa de ellos los israelitas se hicieron escondites en las montañas, cuevas y refugios. Cada vez que Israel sembraba, venían los madianitas, los amalecitas y los pueblos del oriente y los atacaban. Acampaban contra ellos y destruían todo lo que la tierra producía hasta llegar a Gaza, y no dejaban nada para Israel, ni ovejas, ni bueyes, ni asnos. Venían con su ganado y sus carpas, eran tantos como langostas; tanto ellos como sus camellos eran incontables, e invadían la tierra para arrasarla. Así que Israel quedó muy empobrecido por culpa de los madianitas, y los israelitas clamaron al Señor.\n\nCuando los israelitas clamaron al Señor por causa de los madianitas, el Señor les envió un profeta que les dijo: “Así dice el Señor, Dios de Israel: Yo los saqué de Egipto y los libré de la esclavitud. Los rescaté de manos de los egipcios y de todos los que los oprimían, los expulsé de delante de ustedes y les di su tierra. Les dije: ‘Yo soy el Señor su Dios; no teman a los dioses de los amorreos, en cuya tierra viven’. Pero ustedes no me obedecieron”.\n\nEntonces vino un ángel del Señor y se sentó bajo una encina en Ofra, que pertenecía a Joás el abiezerita. Su hijo Gedeón estaba sacudiendo trigo en un lagar para esconderlo de los madianitas. El ángel del Señor se le apareció y le dijo: “El Señor está contigo, valiente guerrero”. Gedeón le respondió: “Ay, Señor mío, si el Señor está con nosotros, ¿por qué nos pasa todo esto? ¿Dónde están todos esos milagros de los que nos hablaron nuestros padres, diciendo: ‘¿No nos sacó el Señor de Egipto?’ Pero ahora el Señor nos ha abandonado y nos ha entregado en manos de los madianitas”.\n\nEl Señor lo miró y le dijo: “Ve con esta fuerza que tienes y salvarás a Israel de manos de los madianitas. ¿No soy yo quien te envía?” Gedeón le respondió: “Ay, Señor mío, ¿con qué salvaré yo a Israel? Mi familia es la más pobre de Manasés, y yo soy el menor en la casa de mi padre”. El Señor le dijo: “Yo estaré contigo, y derrotarás a los madianitas como si fueran un solo hombre”. Gedeón le dijo: “Si he hallado gracia ante tus ojos, dame una señal de que eres tú quien habla conmigo. Te ruego que no te vayas de aquí hasta que vuelva y te traiga mi ofrenda y la ponga delante de ti”. El ángel le respondió: “Me quedaré hasta que regreses”.\n\nGedeón fue, preparó un cabrito y panes sin levadura con una medida de harina; puso la carne en una canasta y el caldo en una olla, y se los llevó al ángel bajo la encina y se los presentó. El ángel de Dios le dijo: “Toma la carne y los panes sin levadura, ponlos sobre esta roca y derrama el caldo encima”. Gedeón lo hizo así. Entonces el ángel del Señor extendió la punta del bastón que tenía en la mano, tocó la carne y los panes sin levadura, y de la roca salió fuego que consumió la carne y los panes. Luego el ángel del Señor desapareció de su vista.\n\nCuando Gedeón se dio cuenta de que era el ángel del Señor, exclamó: “¡Ay de mí, Señor Dios! ¡He visto al ángel del Señor cara a cara!” Pero el Señor le dijo: “Paz a ti, no temas, no morirás”. Entonces Gedeón construyó allí un altar al Señor y lo llamó “El Señor es paz”. Hasta hoy está en Ofra de los abiezeritas.\n\nEsa misma noche el Señor le dijo: “Toma el toro joven de tu padre, el segundo toro de siete años, derriba el altar de Baal que tiene tu padre y corta la imagen de Asera que está junto a él. Luego construye un altar al Señor tu Dios en la cima de este lugar fuerte, en el lugar adecuado, y ofrece el segundo toro en holocausto, usando la madera de la imagen de Asera que cortaste”. Gedeón tomó a diez de sus siervos e hizo como el Señor le había dicho. Pero, como tenía miedo de su familia y de los hombres de la ciudad, lo hizo de noche y no de día.\n\nPor la mañana, cuando los hombres de la ciudad se levantaron, vieron que el altar de Baal estaba derribado, la imagen de Asera cortada y el segundo toro ofrecido en el altar recién construido. Se preguntaron unos a otros: “¿Quién hizo esto?” Y después de investigar, dijeron: “Gedeón, hijo de Joás, lo hizo”. Entonces los hombres de la ciudad le dijeron a Joás: “Saca a tu hijo para que muera, porque ha derribado el altar de Baal y ha cortado la imagen de Asera que estaba junto a él”. Pero Joás respondió a todos los que estaban contra él: “¿Van a defender ustedes a Baal? ¿Van a salvarlo? El que quiera defenderlo, que muera antes de que amanezca. Si Baal es un dios, que se defienda él mismo, ya que han derribado su altar”. Por eso, aquel día llamaron a Gedeón “Jerobaal”, diciendo: “Que Baal contienda contra él, porque derribó su altar”.\n\nEntonces todos los madianitas, amalecitas y los pueblos del oriente se reunieron, cruzaron el río y acamparon en el valle de Jezreel. Pero el Espíritu del Señor vino sobre Gedeón, y él tocó la trompeta, y los abiezeritas se unieron a él. Mandó mensajeros por todo Manasés, que también se unió a él, y envió mensajeros a Aser, Zabulón y Neftalí, y ellos también subieron a reunirse con él.\n\nGedeón le dijo a Dios: “Si vas a salvar a Israel por mi mano, como has dicho, mira, voy a poner un vellón de lana en la era; si el rocío está solo en el vellón y toda la tierra alrededor está seca, sabré que salvarás a Israel por mi mano, como has dicho”. Y así fue: al día siguiente, Gedeón se levantó temprano, exprimió el vellón y sacó de él un tazón lleno de agua. Entonces Gedeón le dijo a Dios: “No te enojes conmigo si te pido una sola cosa más. Permíteme hacer una prueba más con el vellón: que ahora solo el vellón quede seco y que haya rocío en toda la tierra”. Y esa noche Dios lo hizo así: solo el vellón quedó seco y en toda la tierra hubo rocío.",

      "ChapterText": "And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years. | And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds. | And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them; | And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass. | For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it. | And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD. | And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD because of the Midianites, | That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage; | And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you their land; | And I said unto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice. | And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites. | And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valor. | And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites. | And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee? | And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house. | And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man. | And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then show me a sign that thou talkest with me. | Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again. | And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it. | And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so. | Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight. | And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face. | And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die. | Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. | And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it: | And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down. | Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night. | And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built. | And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing. | Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it. | And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar. | Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar. | Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel. | But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him. | And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them. | And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said, | Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said. | And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water. | And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew. | And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.",

      "ChapterText": "Los israelitas ofendieron al SEÑOR, quien por eso los entregó en manos de Madián durante siete años, y así Madián sometió a Israel. Por miedo a los madianitas, los israelitas pusieron señales de fuego en las montañas, hicieron cuevas para refugiarse y construyeron fortalezas. Y sucedía que, cuando los israelitas terminaban de sembrar, Madián, Amalec y los pueblos del oriente subían, acampaban frente a ellos y destruían la cosecha hasta las afueras de Gaza, sin dejar nada de sustento en Israel, ni ovejas, ni bueyes, ni asnos. Venían con su ganado y sus tiendas, y eran tantos como langostas; ni ellos ni sus camellos podían contarse, y entraban en la tierra para arrasarla. Así, Israel quedó sumido en la miseria por causa de Madián, y los israelitas clamaron al SEÑOR. Cuando Israel clamó al SEÑOR por causa de Madián, él envió un profeta a los israelitas, que les dijo: “Así dice el SEÑOR, Dios de Israel: Yo los saqué de Egipto, los saqué de la casa de esclavitud. Los libré del poder de Egipto y de todos sus opresores. Los expulsé delante de ustedes y les di su tierra.

      "ChapterText": "The Israelites offended the LORD, who therefore delivered them into the power of Midian for seven years, | so that Midian held Israel subject. For fear of Midian the Israelites established the fire signals on the mountains, the caves for refuge, and the strongholds. | And it used to be that when the Israelites had completed their sowing, Midian, Amalek and the Kedemites would come up, | encamp opposite them, and destroy the produce of the land as far as the outskirts of Gaza, leaving no sustenance in Israel, nor sheep, oxen or asses. | For they would come up with their livestock, and their tents would become as numerous as locusts; and neither they nor their camels could be numbered, when they came into the land to lay it waste. | Thus was Israel reduced to misery by Midian, and so the Israelites cried out to the LORD. | When Israel cried out to the LORD because of Midian, | he sent a prophet to the Israelites who said to them, \"The LORD, the God of Israel, says: I led you up from Egypt; I brought you out of the place of slavery. | I rescued you from the power of Egypt and of all your other oppressors. I drove them out before you and gave you their land. | And I said to you: I, the LORD, am your God; you shall not venerate the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are dwelling. But you did not obey me.\" | Then the angel of the LORD came and sat under the terebinth in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite. While his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the wine press to save it from the Midianites, | the angel of the LORD appeared to him and said, \"The LORD is with you, O champion!\" | \"My Lord,\" Gideon said to him, \"if the LORD is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are his wondrous deeds of which our fathers told us when they said, 'Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?' For now the LORD has abandoned us and has delivered us into the power of Midian.\" | The LORD turned to him and said, \"Go with the strength you have and save Israel from the power of Midian. It is I who send you.\" | But he answered him, \"Please, my lord, how can I save Israel? My family is the meanest in Manasseh, and I am the most insignificant in my father's house.\" | \"I shall be with you,\" the LORD said to him, \"and you will cut down Midian to the last man.\" | He answered him, \"If I find favor with you, give me a sign that you are speaking with me. | Do not depart from here, I pray you, until I come back to you and bring out my offering and set it before you.\" He answered, \"I will await your return.\" | So Gideon went off and prepared a kid and an ephah of flour in the form of unleavened cakes. Putting the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, he brought them out to him under the terebinth and presented them. | The angel of God said to him, \"Take the meat and unleavened cakes and lay them on this rock; then pour out the broth.\" When he had done so, | the angel of the LORD stretched out the tip of the staff he held, and touched the meat and unleavened cakes. Thereupon a fire came up from the rock which consumed the meat and unleavened cakes, and the angel of the LORD disappeared from sight. | Gideon, now aware that it had been the angel of the LORD, said, \"Alas, Lord GOD, that I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face!\" | The LORD answered him, \"Be calm, do not fear. You shall not die.\" | So Gideon built there an altar to the LORD and called it Yahweh-shalom. To this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. | That same night the LORD said to him, \"Take the seven-year-old spare bullock and destroy your father's altar to Baal and cut down the sacred pole that is by it. | You shall build, instead, the proper kind of altar to the LORD, your God, on top of this stronghold. Then take the spare bullock and offer it as a holocaust on the wood from the sacred pole you have cut down.\" | So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the LORD had commanded him. But through fear of his family and of the townspeople, he would not do it by day, but did it at night. | Early the next morning the townspeople found that the altar of Baal had been destroyed, the sacred pole near it cut down, and the spare bullock offered on the altar that was built. | They asked one another, \"Who did this?\" Their inquiry led them to the conclusion that Gideon, son of Joash, had done it. | So the townspeople said to Joash, \"Bring out your son that he may die, for he has destroyed the altar of Baal and has cut down the sacred pole that was near it.\" | But Joash replied to all who were standing around him, \"Do you intend to act in Baal's stead, or be his champion? If anyone acts for him, he shall be put to death by morning. If he whose altar has been destroyed is a god, let him act for himself!\" | So on that day Gideon was called Jerubbaal, because of the words, \"Let Baal take action against him, since he destroyed his altar.\" | Then all Midian and Amalek and the Kedemites mustered and crossed over into the valley of Jezreel, where they encamped. | The spirit of the LORD enveloped Gideon; he blew the horn that summoned Abiezer to follow him. | He sent messengers, too, throughout Manasseh, which also obeyed his summons; through Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali, likewise, he sent messengers and these tribes advanced to meet the others. | Gideon said to God, \"If indeed you are going to save Israel through me, as you promised, | I am putting this woolen fleece on the threshing floor. If dew comes on the fleece alone, while all the ground is dry, I shall know that you will save Israel through me, as you promised.\" | That is what took place. Early the next morning he wrung the dew from the fleece, squeezing out of it a bowlful of water. | Gideon then said to God, \"Do not be angry with me if I speak once more. Let me make just one more test with the fleece. Let the fleece alone be dry, but let there be dew on all the ground.\" | That night God did so; the fleece alone was dry, but there was dew on all the ground.",

      "ChapterText": "Again the Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. So for seven years he handed them over to the people of Midian. The Midianites treated the Israelites very badly. That’s why the Israelites made places for themselves to hide in the mountains. They also made caves and strongholds. Every time the Israelites planted their crops, the people of Midian, Amalek and other nations from the east came and attacked them. They camped on the land. They destroyed the crops all the way to Gaza. They didn’t spare any living thing for Israel. They didn’t spare sheep or cattle or donkeys. The Midianites came up with their livestock and their tents. They came like a huge swarm of locusts. It was impossible to count all their men and their camels. They came into the land to destroy it. Midian made the Israelites very poor. So they cried out to the Lord for help. They cried out to the Lord because of what Midian had done. The Lord sent a prophet to the Israelites. The prophet said, The Lord is the God of Israel. He says, I brought you up out of Egypt. That is the land where you were slaves. I saved you from the power of Egypt. I saved you from all those who were treating you badly. I drove out the people who lived in the land. I gave you their land. I said to you, I am the Lord your God. Do not worship the gods of the Amorites. You are now living in their land. But you have not listened to me. The angel of the Lord came. He sat down under an oak tree in Ophrah. The tree belonged to Joash. Joash was from the family line of Abiezer. Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress. He was hiding from the Midianites. Gideon was the son of Joash. The angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon. He said, Mighty warrior, the Lord is with you. Pardon me, sir, Gideon replied. You say the Lord is with us. Then why has all of this happened to us? What about all the wonderful things he has done? Our people of long ago told us about them. They said, Didn’t the Lord bring us up out of Egypt? But now the Lord has deserted us. He has handed us over to Midian. The Lord turned to Gideon. He said to him, You are strong. Go and save Israel from the power of Midian. I am sending you. Pardon me, sir, Gideon replied. How can I possibly save Israel? My family group is the weakest in the tribe of Manasseh. And I’m the least important member of my family. The Lord answered, I will be with you. So you will strike down the Midianites. You will leave no one alive. Gideon replied, If you are pleased with me, give me a special sign. Then I’ll know that it’s really you talking to me. Please don’t go away until I come back. I’ll bring my offering and set it down in front of you. The Lord said, I will wait until you return. Gideon went and prepared a young goat. From more than half a bushel of flour he made bread without yeast. He put the meat in a basket. In a pot he put soup made from the meat. Then he brought all of it and offered it to the Lord under the oak tree. The angel of God spoke to Gideon. He said, Take the meat and the bread. Place them on this rock. Then pour out the soup. So Gideon did it. The angel of the Lord had a wooden staff in his hand. With the tip of the staff, he touched the meat and the bread. Fire blazed out from the rock. It burned up the meat and the bread. Then the angel of the Lord disappeared. Gideon realized it was the angel of the Lord. He cried out, Lord and King, I’ve seen the angel of the Lord face to face! But the Lord said to him, May peace be with you! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die. So Gideon built an altar to honor the Lord there. He called it The Lord Is Peace. To this day it stands in Ophrah. Ophrah is in the territory that belongs to the family line of Abiezer. That same night the Lord spoke to Gideon. He said, Get the second bull from your father’s herd. Get the one that is seven years old. Tear down the altar your father built to Baal. Cut down the pole that’s beside it. The pole is used to worship the female god Asherah. Then build the right kind of altar. Build it to honor the Lord your God. Build it on top of this rock. Use the proper stones. Then take the second bull. Sacrifice it as a burnt offering. Use the wood from the pole you cut down. So Gideon went and got ten of his servants. He did just as the Lord had told him. But he was afraid of his family. He was also afraid of the people in the town. So he did everything at night instead of during the day. In the morning the people in the town got up. There was Baal’s altar! It had been torn down. The pole that had been beside it had been cut down. The second bull had been sacrificed on the new altar. The people asked each other, Who did this? They looked into the matter carefully. Someone said, Gideon, the son of Joash, did it. The people in the town spoke to Joash. They ordered him, Bring your son out here. He must die. He has torn down Baal’s altar. He has cut down the Asherah pole beside it. But Joash replied to the angry crowd around him, Are you going to stand up for Baal? Are you going to save him? Anyone who stands up for Baal will be put to death by morning! If Baal really is a god, he can take care of himself. Someone tore down his altar. So from that day on, Gideon was called Jerub-Baal. That’s because Joash said, Let Baal take care of himself. Someone tore down his altar. All the Midianites, Amalekites and other nations from the east joined forces. They went across the Jordan River. They camped in the Valley of Jezreel. Then the Spirit of the Lord came on Gideon. So Gideon blew a trumpet to send for the men of Abiezer. He told them to follow him. He sent messengers all through Manasseh’s territory. He called out all the men to follow him. He also sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali. So they too went up to join the others. Gideon said to God, You promised you would use me to save Israel. Please do something for me. I’ll put a piece of wool on the threshing floor. Suppose dew is only on the wool in the morning. Suppose the ground all around it is dry. Then I’ll know that you will use me to save Israel. I’ll know that your promise will come true. And that’s just what happened. Gideon got up early the next day. He squeezed the wool. He got a full bowl of water out of it. Then Gideon spoke to God again. He said, Don’t be angry with me. Let me ask you just one more thing. Allow me to make one more test with the wool. This time make the wool dry. Let the ground be covered with dew. So that night God did it. Only the wool was dry. All the ground around it was covered with dew.",

      "ChapterText": "Then the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord. So the Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian for seven years, and the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel. Because of the Midianites, the children of Israel made for themselves the dens, the caves, and the strongholds which are in the mountains. So it was, whenever Israel had sown, Midianites would come up; also Amalekites and the people of the East would come up against them. Then they would encamp against them and destroy the produce of the earth as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep nor ox nor donkey. For they would come up with their livestock and their tents, coming in as numerous as locusts; both they and their camels were without number; and they would enter the land to destroy it. So Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites, and the children of Israel cried out to the Lord. And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried out to the Lord because of the Midianites, that the Lord sent a prophet to the children of Israel, who said to them, Thus says the Lord God of Israel: I brought you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of bondage; and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out before you and gave you their land. Also I said to you, I am the Lord your God; do not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. But you have not obeyed My voice. Now the Angel of the Lord came and sat under the terebinth tree which was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon threshed wheat in the winepress, in order to hide it from the Midianites. And the Angel of the Lord appeared to him, and said to him, The Lord is with you, you mighty man of valor! Gideon said to Him, O my lord, if the Lord is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all His miracles which our fathers told us about, saying, Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt? But now the Lord has forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites. Then the Lord turned to him and said, Go in this might of yours, and you shall save Israel from the hand of the Midianites. Have I not sent you? So he said to Him, O my Lord, how can I save Israel? Indeed my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house. And the Lord said to him, Surely I will be with you, and you shall defeat the Midianites as one man. Then he said to Him, If now I have found favor in Your sight, then show me a sign that it is You who talk with me. Do not depart from here, I pray, until I come to You and bring out my offering and set it before You. And He said, I will wait until you come back. So Gideon went in and prepared a young goat, and unleavened bread from an ephah of flour. The meat he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot; and he brought them out to Him under the terebinth tree and presented them. The Angel of God said to him, Take the meat and the unleavened bread and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so. Then the Angel of the Lord put out the end of the staff that was in His hand, and touched the meat and the unleavened bread; and fire rose out of the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread. And the Angel of the Lord departed out of his sight. Now Gideon perceived that He was the Angel of the Lord. So Gideon said, Alas, O Lord God! For I have seen the Angel of the Lord face to face. Then the Lord said to him, Peace be with you; do not fear, you shall not die. So Gideon built an altar there to the Lord, and called it The-Lord-Is-Peace. To this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. Now it came to pass the same night that the Lord said to him, Take your father’s young bull, the second bull of seven years old, and tear down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the wooden image that is beside it; and build an altar to the Lord your God on top of this rock in the proper arrangement, and take the second bull and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the image which you shall cut down. So Gideon took ten men from among his servants and did as the Lord had said to him. But because he feared his father’s household and the men of the city too much to do it by day, he did it by night. And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, there was the altar of Baal, torn down; and the wooden image that was beside it was cut down, and the second bull was being offered on the altar which had been built. So they said to one another, Who has done this thing? And when they had inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing. Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out your son, that he may die, because he has torn down the altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the wooden image that was beside it. But Joash said to all who stood against him, Would you plead for Baal? Would you save him? Let the one who would plead for him be put to death by morning! If he is a god, let him plead for himself, because his altar has been torn down! Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he has torn down his altar. Then all the Midianites and Amalekites, the people of the East, gathered together; and they crossed over and encamped in the Valley of Jezreel. But the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon; then he blew the trumpet, and the Abiezrites gathered behind him. And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, who also gathered behind him. He also sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali; and they came up to meet them. So Gideon said to God, If You will save Israel by my hand as You have said— look, I shall put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor; if there is dew on the fleece only, and it is dry on all the ground, then I shall know that You will save Israel by my hand, as You have said. And it was so. When he rose early the next morning and squeezed the fleece together, he wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water. Then Gideon said to God, Do not be angry with me, but let me speak just once more: Let me test, I pray, just once more with the fleece; let it now be dry only on the fleece, but on all the ground let there be dew. And God did so that night. It was dry on the fleece only, but there was dew on all the ground.",

      "ChapterText": "The Israelites did evil in the Lord’s sight. So the Lord handed them over to the Midianites for seven years. The Midianites were so cruel that the Israelites made hiding places for themselves in the mountains, caves, and strongholds. Whenever the Israelites planted their crops, marauders from Midian, Amalek, and the people of the east would attack Israel, camping in the land and destroying crops as far away as Gaza. They left the Israelites with nothing to eat, taking all the sheep, goats, cattle, and donkeys. These enemy hordes, coming with their livestock and tents, were as thick as locusts. They arrived on droves of camels, too numerous to count, and they stayed until the land was stripped bare. So Israel was reduced to starvation by the Midianites. Then the Israelites cried out to the Lord for help. When they cried out to the Lord because of Midian, the Lord sent a prophet to the Israelites. He said, This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I brought you up out of slavery in Egypt. I rescued you from the Egyptians and from all who oppressed you. I drove out your enemies and gave you their land. I told you, I am the Lord your God. You must not worship the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you now live. But you have not listened to me. Then the angel of the Lord came and sat beneath the great tree at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash of the clan of Abiezer. Gideon son of Joash was threshing wheat at the bottom of a winepress to hide the grain from the Midianites. The angel of the Lord appeared to him and said, Mighty hero, the Lord is with you! Sir, Gideon replied, if the Lord is with us, why has all this happened to us? And where are all the miracles our ancestors told us about? Didn’t they say, The Lord brought us up out of Egypt? But now the Lord has abandoned us and handed us over to the Midianites. Then the Lord turned to him and said, Go with the strength you have, and rescue Israel from the Midianites. I am sending you! But Lord, Gideon replied, how can I rescue Israel? My clan is the weakest in the whole tribe of Manasseh, and I am the least in my entire family! The Lord said to him, I will be with you. And you will destroy the Midianites as if you were fighting against one man. Gideon replied, If you are truly going to help me, show me a sign to prove that it is really the Lord speaking to me. Don’t go away until I come back and bring my offering to you. He answered, I will stay here until you return. Gideon hurried home. He cooked a young goat, and with a basket of flour he baked some bread without yeast. Then, carrying the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, he brought them out and presented them to the angel, who was under the great tree. The angel of God said to him, Place the meat and the unleavened bread on this rock, and pour the broth over it. And Gideon did as he was told. Then the angel of the Lord touched the meat and bread with the tip of the staff in his hand, and fire flamed up from the rock and consumed all he had brought. And the angel of the Lord disappeared. When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the Lord, he cried out, Oh, Sovereign Lord, I’m doomed! I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face! It is all right, the Lord replied. Do not be afraid. You will not die. And Gideon built an altar to the Lord there and named it Yahweh-Shalom (which means the Lord is peace). The altar remains in Ophrah in the land of the clan of Abiezer to this day. That night the Lord said to Gideon, Take the second bull from your father’s herd, the one that is seven years old. Pull down your father’s altar to Baal, and cut down the Asherah pole standing beside it. Then build an altar to the Lord your God here on this hilltop sanctuary, laying the stones carefully. Sacrifice the bull as a burnt offering on the altar, using as fuel the wood of the Asherah pole you cut down. So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the Lord had commanded. But he did it at night because he was afraid of the other members of his father’s household and the people of the town. Early the next morning, as the people of the town began to stir, someone discovered that the altar of Baal had been broken down and that the Asherah pole beside it had been cut down. In their place a new altar had been built, and on it were the remains of the bull that had been sacrificed. The people said to each other, Who did this? And after asking around and making a careful search, they learned that it was Gideon, the son of Joash. Bring out your son, the men of the town demanded of Joash. He must die for destroying the altar of Baal and for cutting down the Asherah pole. But Joash shouted to the mob that confronted him, Why are you defending Baal? Will you argue his case? Whoever pleads his case will be put to death by morning! If Baal truly is a god, let him defend himself and destroy the one who broke down his altar! From then on Gideon was called Jerub-baal, which means Let Baal defend himself, because he broke down Baal’s altar. Soon afterward the armies of Midian, Amalek, and the people of the east formed an alliance against Israel and crossed the Jordan, camping in the Valley of Jezreel. Then the Spirit of the Lord took possession of Gideon. He blew a ram’s horn as a call to arms, and the men of the clan of Abiezer came to him. He also sent messengers throughout Manasseh, Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, summoning their warriors, and all of them responded. Then Gideon said to God, If you are truly going to use me to rescue Israel as you promised, prove it to me in this way. I will put a wool fleece on the threshing floor tonight. If the fleece is wet with dew in the morning but the ground is dry, then I will know that you are going to help me rescue Israel as you promised. And that is just what happened. When Gideon got up early the next morning, he squeezed the fleece and wrung out a whole bowlful of water. Then Gideon said to God, Please don’t be angry with me, but let me make one more request. Let me use the fleece for one more test. This time let the fleece remain dry while the ground around it is wet with dew. So that night God did as Gideon asked. The fleece was dry in the morning, but the ground was covered with dew.",

For I am like one who— when the summer fruit has been gathered after the gleaning of the grape harvest— finds no grape cluster to eat, no early fig, which I crave. | Faithful people have vanished from the land; there is no one upright among the people. All of them wait in ambush to shed blood; they hunt each other with a net. | Both hands are good at accomplishing evil: the official and the judge demand a bribe; when the powerful man communicates his evil desire, they plot it together. | The best of them is like a brier; the most upright is worse than a hedge of thorns. The day of your watchmen, the day of your punishment, is coming; at this time their panic is here. | Do not rely on a friend; don’t trust in a close companion. Seal your mouth from the woman who lies in your arms. | Surely a son considers his father a fool, a daughter opposes her mother, and a daughter-in-law is against her mother-in-law; a person’s enemies are the people in his own home. | But I will look to the Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me. | Do not rejoice over me, my enemy! Though I have fallen, I will stand up; though I sit in darkness, the Lord will be my light. | Because I have sinned against him, I must endure the Lord’s fury until he champions my cause and establishes justice for me. He will bring me into the light; I will see his salvation. | Then my enemy will see, and she will be covered with shame, the one who said to me, “Where is the Lord your God?” My eyes will look at her in triumph; at that time she will be trampled like mud in the streets. | A day will come for rebuilding your walls; on that day your boundary will be extended. | On that day people will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, even from Egypt to the Euphrates River and from sea to sea and mountain to mountain. | Then the earth will become a wasteland because of its inhabitants and as a result of their actions. | Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock that is your possession. They live alone in a woodland surrounded by pastures. Let them graze in Bashan and Gilead as in ancient times. | I will perform miracles for them as in the days of your exodus from the land of Egypt. | Nations will see and be ashamed of all their power. They will put their hands over their mouths, and their ears will become deaf. | They will lick the dust like a snake; they will come trembling out of their hiding places like reptiles slithering on the ground. They will tremble in awe of the Lord our God, and they will fear you. | Who is a God like you, forgiving iniquity and passing over rebellion for the remnant of his inheritance? He does not hold on to his anger forever, because he delights in faithful love. | He will again have compassion on us; he will vanquish our iniquities.

Porque estoy como cuando se recogen los frutos de verano, como los rebuscos de la vendimia: no queda racimo para comer; mi alma deseaba el primer fruto. | El hombre bueno ha desaparecido de la tierra, y no hay nadie recto entre los hombres; todos acechan para derramar sangre, cada uno caza a su hermano con red. | Para hacer el mal con ambas manos con empeño; el príncipe pide, y el juez pide recompensa; el grande manifiesta el deseo de su alma, y así lo confirman. | El mejor de ellos es como un espino; el más recto, más áspero que un seto de espinas. El día de tus centinelas, el día de tu castigo, ha llegado; ahora será su confusión. | No confíes en tu amigo, ni pongas tu esperanza en un guía; cuida lo que dices incluso a la que duerme en tu pecho. | Porque el hijo deshonra al padre, la hija se levanta contra su madre, la nuera contra su suegra; los enemigos de un hombre son los de su propia casa. | Por eso, yo miraré al SEÑOR; esperaré en el Dios de mi salvación; mi Dios me escuchará. | No te alegres de mí, enemiga mía; aunque caiga, me levantaré; aunque more en tinieblas, el SEÑOR será mi luz. | Soportaré la ira del SEÑOR, porque pequé contra él, hasta que defienda mi causa y haga justicia por mí; él me sacará a la luz, y veré su justicia. | Entonces mi enemiga lo verá, y la cubrirá la vergüenza, la que me decía: “¿Dónde está el SEÑOR, tu Dios?” Mis ojos la verán; ahora será pisoteada como lodo en las calles. | El día en que se edificarán tus muros, ese día se alejará el decreto. | Ese día vendrán hasta ti desde Asiria, y desde las ciudades fortificadas, y desde la fortaleza hasta el río, y de mar a mar, y de monte a monte. | Pero la tierra quedará desolada a causa de los que la habitan, por el fruto de sus obras. | Apacienta a tu pueblo con tu cayado, el rebaño de tu heredad, que mora solo en el bosque, en medio del Carmelo; que pasten en Basán y Galaad, como en los días antiguos. | Como en los días en que saliste de la tierra de Egipto, te mostraré maravillas. | Las naciones verán y se avergonzarán de todo su poder; pondrán la mano sobre su boca, sus oídos quedarán sordos. | Lamerán el polvo como la serpiente, como los reptiles de la tierra saldrán temblando de sus escondites; tendrán miedo del SEÑOR nuestro Dios, y temerán delante de ti. | ¿Qué Dios hay como tú, que perdona la iniquidad y olvida el pecado del remanente de su heredad? No retiene para siempre su enojo, porque se complace en la misericordia. | Volverá a tener compasión de nosotros; sepultará nuestras iniquidades; y arrojarás todos nuestros pecados a las profundidades del mar. | Cumplirás la verdad a Jacob y la misericordia a Abraham, que juraste a nuestros padres desde tiempos antiguos.",

They will not be able to speak or hear because of you. | They will eat dust like a snake. They will be like creatures that crawl on the ground. They will come out of their hiding places trembling with fear. They will show respect to the Lord our God. They will also respect you. | Lord, who is a God like you? You forgive sin. You forgive your people when they do what is wrong. You don’t stay angry forever. Instead, you take delight in showing your faithful love to them. | Once again you will show loving concern for us. You will completely wipe out the evil things we’ve done. You will throw all our sins into the bottom of the sea. | You will be true to the people of Jacob. You will show your faithful love to Abraham. That’s what you promised to our people long ago.",

They all lie in wait for blood; Every man hunts his brother with a net. | That they may successfully do evil with both hands— The prince asks for gifts, The judge seeks a bribe, And the great man utters his evil desire; So they scheme together. | The best of them is like a brier; The most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge; The day of your watchman and your punishment comes; Now shall be their perplexity. | Do not trust in a friend; Do not put your confidence in a companion; Guard the doors of your mouth From her who lies in your bosom. | For son dishonors father, Daughter rises against her mother, Daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; A man’s enemies are the men of his own household. | Therefore I will look to the Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation; My God will hear me. | Do not rejoice over me, my enemy; When I fall, I will arise; When I sit in darkness, The Lord will be a light to me. | I will bear the indignation of the Lord, Because I have sinned against Him, Until He pleads my case And executes justice for me. He will bring me forth to the light; I will see His righteousness. | Then she who is my enemy will see, And shame will cover her who said to me, “Where is the Lord your God?” My eyes will see her; Now she will be trampled down Like mud in the streets. | In the day when your walls are to be built, In that day the decree shall go far and wide. | In that day they shall come to you From Assyria and the fortified cities, From the fortress to the River, From sea to sea, And mountain to mountain. | Yet the land shall be desolate Because of those who dwell in it, And for the fruit of their deeds. | Shepherd Your people with Your staff, The flock of Your heritage, Who dwell solitarily in a woodland, In the midst of Carmel; Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, As in days of old. | As in the days when you came out of the land of Egypt, I will show them wonders. | The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might; They shall put their hand over their mouth, Their ears shall be deaf. | They shall lick the dust like a serpent; They shall crawl from their holes like snakes of the earth. They shall be afraid of the Lord our God, And shall fear because of You. | Who is a God like You, Pardoning iniquity And passing over the transgression of the remnant of His heritage? He does not retain His anger forever, Because He delights in mercy. | He will again have compassion on us, And will subdue our iniquities. You will cast all our sins Into the depths of the sea. | You will give truth to Jacob And mercy to Abraham, Which You have sworn to our fathers From days of old.",

      "ChapterText": "How miserable I am! I feel like the fruit picker after the harvest who can find nothing to eat. Not a cluster of grapes or a single early fig can be found to satisfy my hunger. | The godly people have all disappeared; not one honest person is left on the earth. They are all murderers, setting traps even for their own brothers. | Both their hands are equally skilled at doing evil! Officials and judges alike demand bribes. The people with influence get what they want, and together they scheme to twist justice. | Even the best of them is as crooked as a briar; the most honest is as dangerous as a hedge of thorns. But your judgment day is coming swiftly now. Your time of punishment is here, a time of confusion. | Don’t trust anyone— not your best friend or even your wife! | For the son despises his father. The daughter defies her mother. The daughter-in-law defies her mother-in-law. Your enemies are right in your own household! | As for me, I look to the Lord for help. I wait confidently for God to save me, and my God will certainly hear me. | Do not gloat over me, my enemies! For though I fall, I will rise again. Though I sit in darkness, the Lord will be my light. | I will be patient as the Lord punishes me, for I have sinned against him. But after that, he will take up my case and give me justice for all I have suffered from my enemies. The Lord will bring me into the light, and I will see his righteousness. | Then my enemies will see that the Lord is on my side. They will be ashamed that they taunted me, saying, “So where is the Lord— that God of yours?” With my own eyes I will see their downfall; they will be trampled like mud in the streets. | In that day, Israel, your cities will be rebuilt, and your borders will be extended. | People from many lands will come and honor you— from Assyria all the way to the towns of Egypt, from Egypt all the way to the Euphrates River, and from distant seas and mountains. | But the land will become empty and desolate because of the wickedness of those who live there. | O Lord, protect your people with your shepherd’s staff; lead your flock, your special possession. Though they live alone in a thicket on the heights of Mount Carmel, let them graze in the fertile pastures of Bashan and Gilead as they did long ago. | “Yes,” says the Lord, “I will do mighty miracles for you, like those I did when I rescued you from slavery in Egypt.” | All the nations of the world will stand amazed at what the Lord will do for you. They will be embarrassed at their feeble power. They will cover their mouths in silent awe, deaf to everything around them. | Like snakes crawling from their holes, they will come out to meet the Lord our God. They will fear him greatly, trembling in terror at his presence. | Where is another God like you, who pardons the guilt of the remnant, overlooking the sins of his special people? You will not stay angry with your people forever, because you delight in showing unfailing love. | Once again you will have compassion on us. You will trample our sins under your feet and throw them into the depths of the ocean! | You will show us your faithfulness and unfailing love as you promised to our ancestors Abraham and Jacob long ago.",

Les dijo: “Así dice el Señor de los ejércitos: Este pueblo dice que todavía no ha llegado el momento de reconstruir la casa del Señor.” \n\nEntonces el Señor volvió a hablar por medio del profeta Hageo: “¿Acaso es momento para que ustedes vivan en casas lujosas mientras mi casa está en ruinas? Así dice el Señor de los ejércitos: Reflexionen sobre su conducta. Han sembrado mucho, pero cosechan poco; comen, pero no quedan satisfechos; beben, pero no se sacian; se visten, pero no logran abrigarse; y el que trabaja por un salario, lo guarda en un saco roto. Así dice el Señor de los ejércitos: Reflexionen sobre su conducta. Suban al monte, traigan madera y reconstruyan mi casa. Yo me complaceré en ella y mostraré mi gloria, dice el Señor. \n\nEsperaban mucho, pero resultó ser poco; y lo que trajeron a casa, yo lo hice desaparecer. ¿Por qué? —dice el Señor de los ejércitos—. Porque mi casa está en ruinas, mientras cada uno de ustedes se ocupa de la suya. Por eso, los cielos han retenido el rocío y la tierra sus frutos. Yo llamé a una sequía sobre el país, sobre los montes, sobre el trigo, el vino nuevo, el aceite, sobre todo lo que produce la tierra, sobre los hombres, el ganado y todo el trabajo de sus manos.”\n\nEntonces Zorobabel, hijo de Salatiel, y Josué, hijo de Josadac, el sumo sacerdote, junto con todo el resto del pueblo, obedecieron la voz del Señor su Dios y las palabras del profeta Hageo, porque el Señor su Dios lo había enviado, y el pueblo sintió temor ante el Señor. \n\nEntonces Hageo, el mensajero del Señor, transmitió al pueblo este mensaje de parte del Señor: “Yo estoy con ustedes, dice el Señor.” Y el Señor motivó el espíritu de Zorobabel, hijo de Salatiel, gobernador de Judá, el espíritu de Josué, hijo de Josadac, el sumo sacerdote, y el espíritu de todo el resto del pueblo. Así que vinieron y comenzaron a trabajar en la casa del Señor de los ejércitos, su Dios, el día veinticuatro del sexto mes, en el segundo año del reinado de Darío.",

Why? saith the LORD of hosts. Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every man unto his own house. | Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit. | And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands. | Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the LORD. | Then spake Haggai the LORD's messenger in the LORD's message unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith the LORD. | And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God, | In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.",

Que la gracia, la misericordia y la paz estén con ustedes, de parte de Dios el Padre y de Jesucristo, el Hijo del Padre, en verdad y amor.

Y ahora te ruego, señora, no como si te escribiera un mandamiento nuevo, sino el que hemos tenido desde el principio: que nos amemos unos a otros. Y este es el amor: que andemos conforme a sus mandamientos. Este es el mandamiento, que, como lo han oído desde el principio, anden en él. Porque muchos engañadores han salido al mundo, que no confiesan que Jesucristo ha venido en carne. Ese es el engañador y el anticristo. Cuídense, para que no pierdan lo que hemos trabajado, sino que reciban la recompensa completa. Todo el que se desvía y no permanece en la enseñanza de Cristo, no tiene a Dios; el que permanece en la enseñanza, ese sí tiene al Padre y al Hijo. Si alguien viene a ustedes y no trae esta enseñanza, no lo reciban en casa ni le den la bienvenida, porque quien le da la bienvenida participa en sus malas obras. Tengo muchas cosas que escribirles, pero no quiero hacerlo con papel y tinta, sino que espero ir a verlos y hablar cara a cara, para que nuestra alegría sea completa. Los hijos de tu hermana elegida te mandan saludos. Amén.",

And the God of peace will be with you. | I rejoice greatly in the Lord that at last you have renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you have been concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it. | I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. | I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. | I can do everything through him who gives me strength. | Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles. | Moreover, as you Philippians know, in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel, when I set out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you only; | for even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid again and again when I was in need. | Not that I am looking for a gift, but I am looking for what may be credited to your account. | I have received full payment and even more; I am amply supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent. They are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God. | And my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus. | To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever.

Again I will say, rejoice! | Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is at hand. | Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; | and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. | Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy—meditate on these things. | The things which you learned and received and heard and saw in me, these do, and the God of peace will be with you. | But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last your care for me has flourished again; though you surely did care, but you lacked opportunity. | Not that I speak in regard to need, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content: | I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in all things I have learned both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. | I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. | Nevertheless you have done well that you shared in my distress. | Now you Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church shared with me concerning giving and receiving but you only. | For even in Thessalonica you sent aid once and again for my necessities. | Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that abounds to your account. | Indeed I have all and abound. I am full, having received from Epaphroditus the things sent from you, a sweet-smelling aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well pleasing to God. | And my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus. | Now to our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen. | Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me greet you. | All the saints greet you, but especially those who are of Caesar’s household. | The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.",

They worked along with Clement and the rest of my co-workers, whose names are written in the Book of Life. | Always be full of joy in the Lord. I say it again—rejoice! | Let everyone see that you are considerate in all you do. Remember, the Lord is coming soon. | Don’t worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done. | Then you will experience God’s peace, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus. | And now, dear brothers and sisters, one final thing. Fix your thoughts on what is true, and honorable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable. Think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise. | Keep putting into practice all you learned and received from me—everything you heard from me and saw me doing. Then the God of peace will be with you. | How I praise the Lord that you are concerned about me again. I know you have always been concerned for me, but you didn’t have the chance to help me. | Not that I was ever in need, for I have learned how to be content with whatever I have. | I know how to live on almost nothing or with everything. I have learned the secret of living in every situation, whether it is with a full stomach or empty, with plenty or little. | For I can do everything through Christ, who gives me strength. | Even so, you have done well to share with me in my present difficulty. | As you know, you Philippians were the only ones who gave me financial help when I first brought you the Good News and then traveled on from Macedonia. No other church did this. | Even when I was in Thessalonica you sent help more than once. | I don’t say this because I want a gift from you. Rather, I want you to receive a reward for your kindness. | At the moment I have all I need—and more! I am generously supplied with the gifts you sent me with Epaphroditus. They are a sweet-smelling sacrifice that is acceptable and pleasing to God. | And this same God who takes care of me will supply all your needs from his glorious riches, which have been given to us in Christ Jesus. | Now all glory to God our Father forever and ever! Amen. | Give my greetings to each of God’s holy people—all who belong to Christ Jesus.

March out for battle! | Get the horses and chariots ready to ride! Take your positions! Put on your helmets! Polish your spears! Put on your armor! | What do I see? The soldiers are terrified. They are running away. Their brave men are beaten down. They try to escape as fast as they can. But they do not look back. There is terror on every side,” announces the Lord. | The fastest soldiers can’t run away. The strongest can’t escape. In the north by the Euphrates River they trip and fall. | \"Egypt rises like the Nile River. The waters of that river rise up like a flood. Egypt says, 'I will rise and cover the earth. I will destroy cities and their people.' | Charge, you horses! Drive wildly, you chariot drivers! March on, you soldiers from Cush and Put who carry shields! March on, you soldiers from Lydia who use bows! | But that day belongs to the Lord. He is the Lord who rules over all. It is a day to pay back his enemies. His sword will kill them until he has had enough. His sword will kill them until it has drunk its fill of their blood. The Lord who rules over all will offer a sacrifice in the land of the north. He will offer it by the Euphrates River. | People of Egypt, go up to Gilead and get some healing lotion. But you will try many other remedies without success. You can’t be healed. | The nations will hear about your shame. Your cries of pain will fill the earth. One soldier will trip over another. Both of them will fall down together.” | Here is the message the Lord spoke to Jeremiah the prophet. It was about Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylonia. He was going to attack Egypt. | \"Announce this message in Egypt. Proclaim it in Migdol. Announce it in Memphis and Tahpanhes. Say, 'Take your positions! Get ready! Swords will destroy those around you.' | Why will your soldiers be defeated? They will not stand, because I will push them down. | They will trip again and again. They will fall over one another. They will say, 'Get up. Let’s go back to our own people. Let’s return to our own land. Let’s get away from the sword of the one who wins.' | There they will say, 'Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, is just a loud noise. He has missed his chance to win the battle.' | \"I am the King. My name is the Lord who rules over all. And as surely as I live, someone will come. He will be like Mount Tabor among the mountains. He will be like Mount Carmel by the Mediterranean Sea. | People of Egypt, pack your belongings for being taken away as prisoners. Memphis will be destroyed. It will be left empty. No one will live there. | Egypt is like a beautiful young cow. But a horsefly is coming from the north to attack her. | The hired soldiers in Egypt are like fattened calves. But they too will turn and run away together. They will not stand their ground. The day to destroy them has come. The time for them to be punished has arrived. | Egypt will hiss like a snake that is trying to get away. The enemy will come with a large army. They will attack Egypt with axes, as if they were cutting down trees. | Egypt is like a forest that can’t be found. But those who are coming to destroy it are more than locusts. They can’t even be counted. | The people of Egypt will be put to shame. They will be handed over to those from the north.” | The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel. He says, \"I will punish Amon, the god of Thebes. I will also punish Pharaoh and Egypt. I will punish their gods and their kings. I will punish those who depend on Pharaoh. | I will hand them over to those who want to kill them. I will hand them over to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylonia, and his officers. But later Egypt will be filled with people again. | \"People of Jacob, do not be afraid. Do not be terrified, Israel. I will save you from a land far away. I will save your children from the land where they are prisoners. Jacob, you will have peace and safety again. No one will make you afraid. | People of Jacob, I am with you. I will save you,\" announces the Lord. \"I will completely destroy all the nations where I scatter you. But I will not completely destroy you. I will correct you. I will be fair. I will not let you go without being punished.\"",

Están aterrados, retroceden, sus guerreros han sido derrotados. Huyen apresurados sin mirar atrás, y hay terror por todas partes”, declara el SEÑOR. \n“El veloz no podrá huir ni el fuerte escapar. En el norte, junto al río Éufrates, tropiezan y caen. \n\n¿Quién es este que sube como el Nilo, como ríos de aguas impetuosas? \nEgipto sube como el Nilo, como ríos de aguas impetuosas. Ella dice: ‘Subiré y cubriré la tierra; destruiré ciudades y a sus habitantes’. \n¡Adelante, caballos! ¡Avancen con furia, conductores de carros! ¡Marchen, guerreros: hombres de Cus y de Fut que portan escudos, hombres de Lud que tensan el arco! \n\nPero ese día le pertenece al SEÑOR, al Señor Todopoderoso, un día de venganza, para vengarse de sus enemigos. La espada devorará hasta saciarse, hasta calmar su sed de sangre. Porque el Señor, el SEÑOR Todopoderoso, ofrecerá sacrificio en la tierra del norte, junto al río Éufrates. \n\n“Sube a Galaad y busca bálsamo, Virgen hija de Egipto. Pero multiplicas los remedios en vano; no hay sanidad para ti. \nLas naciones oirán de tu vergüenza; tus gritos llenarán la tierra. Un guerrero tropezará con otro, y ambos caerán juntos”.\n\nEste es el mensaje que el SEÑOR habló a Jeremías el profeta sobre la venida de Nabucodonosor, rey de Babilonia, para atacar Egipto:\n\n“Anúncienlo en Egipto, proclámenlo en Migdol; proclámenlo también en Menfis y en Tafnes: ‘Tomen sus posiciones y prepárense, porque la espada devora a los que están a su alrededor’. \n¿Por qué han caído tus valientes? No pueden mantenerse en pie, porque el SEÑOR los ha derribado. \nTropezarán una y otra vez; caerán unos sobre otros. Dirán: ‘¡Levántense, volvamos a nuestro pueblo y a nuestra tierra natal, lejos de la espada del opresor!’ \nAllí exclamarán: ‘El faraón, rey de Egipto, no es más que un ruido; ha dejado pasar su oportunidad’. \n\n“Tan cierto como que yo vivo”, declara el Rey, cuyo nombre es el SEÑOR Todopoderoso, “vendrá uno que será como el Tabor entre los montes, como el Carmelo junto al mar. \nPrepara tus pertenencias para el destierro, habitante de Egipto, porque Menfis quedará desolada, convertida en ruinas sin habitantes. \n\n“Egipto es una hermosa novilla, pero del norte viene un tábano contra ella. \nLos mercenarios en sus filas son como becerros engordados. También ellos huirán juntos, no resistirán, porque les llega el día de su desastre, el tiempo de su castigo. \nEgipto silbará como una serpiente que huye mientras el enemigo avanza con fuerza; vendrán contra ella con hachas, como leñadores. \nDerribarán su bosque”, declara el SEÑOR, “por denso que sea. Son más numerosos que las langostas, no se les puede contar. \nLa hija de Egipto será avergonzada, entregada en manos del pueblo del norte”.\n\nEl SEÑOR Todopoderoso, el Dios de Israel, dice: “Voy a castigar a Amón, dios de Tebas, al faraón, a Egipto, a sus dioses y a sus reyes, y a los que confían en el faraón. \nLos entregaré en manos de quienes buscan su vida, a Nabucodonosor, rey de Babilonia, y a sus oficiales. Pero después, Egipto volverá a ser habitado como en tiempos pasados”, declara el SEÑOR.\n\n“No temas, siervo mío Jacob; no te asustes, Israel. Yo te salvaré de un lugar lejano, a tus descendientes de la tierra de su cautiverio. Jacob volverá a tener paz y seguridad, y nadie lo atemorizará. \nNo temas, siervo mío Jacob, porque yo estoy contigo”, declara el SEÑOR. “Aunque destruya por completo a todas las naciones entre las que te he dispersado, a ti no te destruiré del todo. Te corregiré con justicia, pero no te dejaré sin castigo”.",

Over the wheat and the barley, because the harvest of the field has perished. | The vine has dried up, the fig tree is withered; The pomegranate, the date palm also, and the apple, all the trees of the field are dried up; Yes, joy has withered away from among mankind. | Gird yourselves and weep, O priests! wail, O ministers of the altar! Come, spend the night in sackcloth, O ministers of my God! The house of your God is deprived of offering and libation. | Proclaim a fast, call an assembly; Gather the elders, all who dwell in the land, Into the house of the LORD, your God, and cry to the LORD! | Alas, the day! for near is the day of the LORD, and it comes as ruin from the Almighty. | From before our very eyes has not the food been cut off; And from the house of our God, joy and gladness? | The seed lies shriveled under its clods; the stores are destroyed, The barns are broken down, for the grain has failed. | How the beasts groan! The herds of cattle are bewildered! Because they have no pasturage, even the flocks of sheep have perished. | To you, O LORD, I cry! for fire has devoured the pastures of the plain, and flame has enkindled all the trees of the field. | Even the beasts of the field cry out to you; For the streams of water are dried up, and fire has devoured the pastures of the plain.",

Only the poorest people of the land were left. | Nebuchadnezzar took Jehoiachin captive to Babylon.

His mother's name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah. | He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, just as Jehoiakim had done. | It was because of the LORD's anger that all this happened to Jerusalem and Judah, and in the end he thrust them from his presence.

Pero luego cambió de opinión y se rebeló contra Nabucodonosor. El SEÑOR envió contra él bandas de babilonios, arameos, moabitas y amonitas. Los envió para destruir Judá, tal como lo había anunciado el SEÑOR por medio de sus siervos los profetas. Sin duda, todo esto le sucedió a Judá por orden del SEÑOR, para apartarlos de su presencia debido a los pecados de Manasés y todo lo que él había hecho, incluyendo el derramamiento de sangre inocente. Porque llenó Jerusalén de sangre inocente, y el SEÑOR no quiso perdonar. En cuanto al resto de los hechos del reinado de Joacim y todo lo que hizo, ¿no está escrito en el libro de las crónicas de los reyes de Judá? Joacim descansó con sus antepasados, y su hijo Joaquín lo sucedió como rey. El rey de Egipto no volvió a salir de su país, porque el rey de Babilonia le había quitado todo su territorio, desde el arroyo de Egipto hasta el río Éufrates.\n\nJoaquín tenía dieciocho años cuando comenzó a reinar, y reinó en Jerusalén tres meses. Su madre se llamaba Nehusta, hija de Elnatán, y era de Jerusalén. Él hizo lo malo ante los ojos del SEÑOR, igual que su padre. En ese tiempo, los oficiales de Nabucodonosor, rey de Babilonia, avanzaron contra Jerusalén y la sitiaron, y el mismo Nabucodonosor llegó a la ciudad mientras sus oficiales la sitiaban. Joaquín, rey de Judá, su madre, sus sirvientes, sus nobles y sus funcionarios se rindieron a él. En el octavo año del reinado del rey de Babilonia, Nabucodonosor tomó prisionero a Joaquín.\n\nTal como el SEÑOR lo había anunciado, Nabucodonosor se llevó todos los tesoros del templo del SEÑOR y del palacio real, y se llevó todos los objetos de oro que Salomón, rey de Israel, había hecho para el templo del SEÑOR. Se llevó al exilio a todo Jerusalén: a todos los oficiales y soldados, y a todos los artesanos y herreros, en total unas diez mil personas. Solo dejó a los más pobres del país. Nabucodonosor llevó cautivo a Joaquín a Babilonia. También se llevó de Jerusalén a Babilonia a la madre del rey, a sus esposas, a sus funcionarios y a los principales del país. El rey de Babilonia también deportó a Babilonia a toda la fuerza de siete mil soldados aptos para la guerra y a mil artesanos y herreros. Puso como rey en lugar de Joaquín a Matanías, tío de Joaquín, y le cambió el nombre a Sedequías.\n\nSedequías tenía veintiún años cuando comenzó a reinar, y reinó en Jerusalén once años. Su madre se llamaba Hamutal, hija de Jeremías, y era de Libná. Él hizo lo malo ante los ojos del SEÑOR, igual que Joacim. Todo esto le sucedió a Jerusalén y a Judá por causa del enojo del SEÑOR, y al final los expulsó de su presencia. Y Sedequías se rebeló contra el rey de Babilonia.",

This is the name by which he will be called: The LORD Our Righteousness. | \"So then, the days are coming,\" declares the LORD, \"when people will no longer say, 'As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the Israelites up out of Egypt,' | but they will say, 'As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the descendants of Israel up out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had banished them.' Then they will live in their own land.\" | Concerning the prophets: My heart is broken within me; all my bones tremble. I am like a drunken man, like a man overcome by wine, because of the LORD and his holy words. | The land is full of adulterers; because of the curse the land lies parched and the pastures in the desert are withered. The prophets follow an evil course and use their power unjustly. | \"Both prophet and priest are godless; even in my temple I find their wickedness,\" declares the LORD. | \"Therefore their path will become slippery; they will be banished to darkness and there they will fall. I will bring disaster on them in the year they are punished,\" declares the LORD. | \"Among the prophets of Samaria I saw this repulsive thing: They prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel astray. | And among the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen something horrible: They commit adultery and live a lie. They strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that no one turns from his wickedness. They are all like Sodom to me; the people of Jerusalem are like Gomorrah.\" | Therefore, this is what the LORD Almighty says concerning the prophets: \"I will make them eat bitter food and drink poisoned water, because from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has spread throughout the land.\" | This is what the LORD Almighty says: \"Do not listen to what the prophets are prophesying to you; they fill you with false hopes. They speak visions from their own minds, not from the mouth of the LORD. | They keep saying to those who despise me, 'The LORD says: You will have peace.' And to all who follow the stubbornness of their hearts they say, 'No harm will come to you.' | But which of them has stood in the council of the LORD to see or to hear his word? Who has listened and heard his word? | See, the storm of the LORD will burst out in wrath, a whirlwind swirling down on the heads of the wicked. | The anger of the LORD will not turn back until he fully accomplishes the purposes of his heart.

I had a dream!' | How long will this continue in the hearts of these lying prophets, who prophesy the delusions of their own minds? | They think the dreams they tell one another will make my people forget my name, just as their fathers forgot my name through Baal worship. | Let the prophet who has a dream tell his dream, but let the one who has my word speak it faithfully. For what has straw to do with grain?\" declares the LORD. | \"Is not my word like fire,\" declares the LORD, \"and like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces? | \"Therefore,\" declares the LORD, \"I am against the prophets who steal from one another words supposedly from me. | Yes,\" declares the LORD, \"I am against the prophets who wag their own tongues and yet declare, 'The LORD declares.' | Indeed, I am against those who prophesy false dreams,\" declares the LORD. \"They tell them and lead my people astray with their reckless lies, yet I did not send or appoint them. They do not benefit these people in the least,\" declares the LORD. | \"When these people, or a prophet or a priest, ask you, 'What is the oracle of the LORD?' say to them, 'What oracle? I will forsake you, declares the LORD.' | If a prophet or a priest or anyone else claims, 'This is the oracle of the LORD,' I will punish that man and his household. | This is what each of you keeps on saying to his friend or relative: 'What is the LORD's answer?' or 'What has the LORD spoken?' | But you must not mention 'the oracle of the LORD 'again, because every man's own word becomes his oracle and so you distort the words of the living God, the LORD Almighty, our God. | This is what you keep saying to a prophet: 'What is the LORD's answer to you?' or 'What has the LORD spoken?' | Although you claim, 'This is the oracle of the LORD,' this is what the LORD says: You used the words, 'This is the oracle of the LORD,' even though I told you that you must not claim, 'This is the oracle of the LORD.' | Therefore, I will surely forget you and cast you out of my presence along with the city I gave to you and your fathers. | I will bring upon you everlasting disgrace-everlasting shame that will not be forgotten.\"",

Wrath has gone forth, a whirling tempest; it will burst upon the head of the wicked. | The anger of the LORD will not turn back until he has executed and accomplished the intents of his heart. In the latter days you will understand it clearly. | \"I did not send the prophets, yet they ran; I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied. | But if they had stood in my council, then they would have proclaimed my words to my people, and they would have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their deeds. | \"Am I a God at hand, declares the LORD, and not a God afar off? | Can a man hide himself in secret places so that I cannot see him? declares the LORD.

What has straw in common with wheat? declares the LORD. | Is not my word like fire, declares the LORD, and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces? | Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, declares the LORD, who steal my words from one another. | Behold, I am against the prophets, declares the LORD, who use their tongues and declare, 'declares the LORD.' | Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams, declares the LORD, and who tell them and lead my people astray by their lies and their recklessness, when I did not send them or charge them.

In the darkness they shall lose their footing, and fall headlong; Evil I will bring upon them: the year of their punishment, says the LORD. | Among Samaria's prophets I saw unseemly deeds: They prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel astray. | But among Jerusalem's prophets I saw deeds still more shocking: Adultery, living in lies, siding with the wicked, so that no one turns from evil; To me they are all like Sodom, its citizens like Gomorrah. | Therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts against the prophets: Behold, I will give them wormwood to eat, and poison to drink; For from Jerusalem's prophets ungodliness has gone forth into the whole land. | Thus says the LORD of hosts: Listen not to the words of your prophets, who fill you with emptiness; Visions of their own fancy they speak, not from the mouth of the LORD. | They say to those who despise the word of the LORD, \"Peace shall be yours\"; And to everyone who walks in hardness of heart, \"No evil shall overtake you.\" | Now, who has stood in the council of the LORD, to see him and to hear his word? Who has heeded his word, so as to announce it? | See, the storm of the LORD! His wrath breaks forth In a whirling storm that bursts upon the heads of the wicked. | The anger of the LORD shall not abate until he has done and fulfilled what he has determined in his heart. When the time comes, you shall fully understand. | I did not send these prophets, yet they ran; I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied. | Had they stood in my council, and did they but proclaim to my people my words, They would have brought them back from evil ways and from their wicked deeds. | Am I a God near at hand only, says the LORD, and not a God far off? | Can a man hide in secret without my seeing him? says the LORD. Do I not fill both heaven and earth? says the LORD. | I have heard the prophets who prophesy lies in my name say, \"I had a dream! I had a dream!\" | How long will this continue? Is my name in the hearts of the prophets who prophesy lies and their own deceitful fancies? | By their dreams which they recount to each other, they think to make my people forget my name, just as their fathers forgot my name for Baal. | Let the prophet who has a dream recount his dream; let him who has my word speak my word truthfully! What has straw to do with the wheat? says the LORD. | Is not my word like fire, says the LORD, like a hammer shattering rocks? | Therefore I am against the prophets, says the LORD, who steal my words from each other. | Yes, I am against the prophets, says the LORD, who borrow speeches to pronounce oracles. | Yes, I am against the prophets who prophesy lying dreams, says the LORD, and who lead my people astray by recounting their lies and by their empty boasting. From me they have no mission or command, and they do this people no good at all, says the LORD. | And when this people, or a prophet or a priest asks you, \"What is the burden of the LORD?\" you shall answer, \"You are the burden, and I cast you off, says the LORD.\" | If a prophet or a priest or anyone else mentions \"the burden of the LORD,\" I will punish that man and his house. | Thus you shall ask, when speaking to one another, \"What answer did the LORD give?\" or, \"What did the LORD say?\" | But the burden of the LORD you shall mention no more. For each man his own word becomes the burden so that you pervert the words of the living God, the LORD of hosts, our God. | Thus shall you ask the prophet, \"What answer did the LORD give?\" or, \"What did the LORD say?\" | But if you ask about \"the burden of the LORD,\" then thus says the LORD: Because you use this phrase, \"the burden of the LORD,\" though I forbade you to use it, | therefore I will lift you on high and cast you from my presence, you and the city which I gave to you and your fathers. | And I will bring upon you eternal reproach, eternal, unforgettable shame.",

Behold, I will attend to you for the evil of your doings, says the Lord. | But I will gather the remnant of My flock out of all countries where I have driven them, and bring them back to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase. | I will set up shepherds over them who will feed them; and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, nor shall they be lacking, says the Lord. | Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, That I will raise to David a Branch of righteousness; A King shall reign and prosper, And execute judgment and righteousness in the earth. | In His days Judah will be saved, And Israel will dwell safely; Now this is His name by which He will be called: THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. | Therefore, behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, that they shall no longer say, As the Lord lives who brought up the children of Israel from the land of Egypt, | but, As the Lord lives who brought up and led the descendants of the house of Israel from the north country and from all the countries where I had driven them. And they shall dwell in their own land. | My heart within me is broken Because of the prophets; All my bones shake. I am like a drunken man, And like a man whom wine has overcome, Because of the Lord, And because of His holy words. | For the land is full of adulterers; For because of a curse the land mourns. The pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up. Their course of life is evil, And their might is not right. | For both prophet and priest are profane; Yes, in My house I have found their wickedness, says the Lord. | Therefore their way shall be to them Like slippery ways; In the darkness they shall be driven on And fall in them; For I will bring disaster on them, The year of their punishment, says the Lord. | And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria: They prophesied by Baal And caused My people Israel to err. | Also I have seen a horrible thing in the prophets of Jerusalem: They commit adultery and walk in lies; They also strengthen the hands of evildoers, So that no one turns back from his wickedness. All of them are like Sodom to Me, And her inhabitants like Gomorrah. | Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, And make them drink the water of gall; For from the prophets of Jerusalem Profaneness has gone out into all the land. | Thus says the Lord of hosts: Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you. They make you worthless; They speak a vision of their own heart, Not from the mouth of the Lord. | They continually say to those who despise Me, The Lord has said, You shall have peace; And to everyone who walks according to the dictates of his own heart, they say, No evil shall come upon you. | For who has stood in the counsel of the Lord, And has perceived and heard His word? Who has marked His word and heard it? | Behold, a whirlwind of the Lord has gone forth in fury—A violent whirlwind! It will fall violently on the head of the wicked. | The anger of the Lord will not turn back Until He has executed and performed the thoughts of His heart. In the latter days you will understand it perfectly. | I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran. I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied. | But if they had stood in My counsel, And had caused My people to hear My words, Then they would have turned them from their evil way And from the evil of their doings. | Am I a God near at hand, says the Lord, And not a God afar off? | Can anyone hide himself in secret places, So I shall not see him? says the Lord; Do I not fill heaven and earth? says the Lord. | I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in My name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed! | How long will this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies? Indeed they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart, | who try to make My people forget My name by their dreams which everyone tells his neighbor, as their fathers forgot My name for Baal. | The prophet who has a dream, let him tell a dream; And he who has My word, let him speak My word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? says the Lord. | Is not My word like a fire? says the Lord, And like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces? | Therefore behold, I am against the prophets, says the Lord, who steal My words every one from his neighbor. | Behold, I am against the prophets, says the Lord, who use their tongues and say, He says. | Behold, I am against those who prophesy false dreams, says the Lord, and tell them, and cause My people to err by their lies and by their recklessness. Yet I did not send them or command them; therefore they shall not profit this people at all, says the Lord. | So when these people or the prophet or the priest ask you, saying, What is the oracle of the Lord? you shall then say to them, What oracle? I will even forsake you, says the Lord. | And as for the prophet and the priest and the people who say, The oracle of the Lord! I will even punish that man and his house. | Thus every one of you shall say to his neighbor, and every one to his brother, What has the Lord answered? and, What has the Lord spoken? | And the oracle of the Lord you shall mention no more. For every man's word will be his oracle, for you have perverted the words of the living God, the Lord of hosts, our God. | Thus you shall say to the prophet, What has the Lord answered you? and, What has the Lord spoken? | But since you say, The oracle of the Lord! therefore thus says the Lord: Because you say this word, The oracle of the Lord! and I have sent to you, saying, Do not say, The oracle of the Lord! | therefore behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you and forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and will cast you out of My presence. | And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.",

      "ChapterText": "What sorrow awaits the leaders of my people—the shepherds of my sheep—for they have destroyed and scattered the very ones they were expected to care for, says the Lord. | Therefore, this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says to these shepherds: Instead of caring for my flock and leading them to safety, you have deserted them and driven them to destruction. Now I will pour out judgment on you for the evil you have done to them. | But I will gather together the remnant of my flock from the countries where I have driven them. I will bring them back to their own sheepfold, and they will be fruitful and increase in number. | Then I will appoint responsible shepherds to care for them, and they will never be afraid again. Not a single one will be lost or missing. I, the Lord, have spoken! | For the time is coming, says the Lord, when I will raise up a righteous descendant from King David’s line. He will be a King who rules with wisdom. He will do what is just and right throughout the land. | And this will be his name: The Lord Is Our Righteousness. In that day Judah will be saved, and Israel will live in safety. | In that day, says the Lord, when people are taking an oath, they will no longer say, As surely as the Lord lives, who rescued the people of Israel from the land of Egypt. | Instead, they will say, As surely as the Lord lives, who brought the people of Israel back to their own land from the land of the north and from all the countries to which he had exiled them. Then they will live in their own land. | My heart is broken because of the false prophets, and my bones tremble. I stagger like a drunkard, like someone overcome by wine, because of the holy words the Lord has spoken against them. | For the land is full of adultery, and it lies under a curse. The land itself is in mourning—its wilderness pastures are dried up. For they all do evil and abuse what power they have. | Even the priests and prophets are ungodly, wicked men. I have seen their despicable acts right here in my own Temple, says the Lord. | Therefore, the paths they take will become slippery. They will be chased through the dark, and there they will fall. For I will bring disaster upon them at the time fixed for their punishment. I, the Lord, have spoken! | I saw that the prophets of Samaria were terribly evil, for they prophesied in the name of Baal and led my people of Israel into sin. | But now I see that the prophets of Jerusalem are even worse! They commit adultery and love dishonesty. They encourage those who are doing evil so that no one turns away from their sins. These prophets are as wicked as the people of Sodom and Gomorrah once were. | Therefore, this is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies says concerning the prophets: I will feed them with bitterness and give them poison to drink. For it is because of Jerusalem’s prophets that wickedness has filled this land. | This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies says to his people: Do not listen to these prophets when they prophesy to you, filling you with futile hopes. They are making up everything they say. They do not speak for the Lord! | They keep saying to those who despise my word, Don’t worry! The Lord says you will have peace! And to those who stubbornly follow their own desires, they say, No harm will come your way! | Have any of these prophets been in the Lord’s presence to hear what he is really saying? Has even one of them cared enough to listen? | Look! The Lord’s anger bursts out like a storm, a whirlwind that swirls down on the heads of the wicked. | The anger of the Lord will not diminish until it has finished all he has planned. In the days to come you will understand all this very clearly. | I have not sent these prophets, yet they run around claiming to speak for me. I have given them no message, yet they go on prophesying. | If they had stood before me and listened to me, they would have spoken my words, and they would have turned my people from their evil ways and deeds. | Am I a God who is only close at hand? says the Lord. No, I am far away at the same time. | Can anyone hide from me in a secret place? Am I not everywhere in all the heavens and earth? says the Lord. | I have heard these prophets say, Listen to the dream I had from God last night. And then they proceed to tell lies in my name. | How long will this go on? If they are prophets, they are prophets of deceit, inventing everything they say. | By telling these false dreams, they are trying to get my people to forget me, just as their ancestors did by worshiping the idols of Baal. | Let these false prophets tell their dreams, but let my true messengers faithfully proclaim my every word. There is a difference between straw and grain! | Does not my word burn like fire? says the Lord. Is it not like a mighty hammer that smashes a rock to pieces? | Therefore, says the Lord, I am against these prophets who steal messages from each other and claim they are from me. | I am against these smooth-tongued prophets who say, This prophecy is from the Lord! | I am against these false prophets. Their imaginary dreams are flagrant lies that lead my people into sin. I did not send or appoint them, and they have no message at all for my people. I, the Lord, have spoken! | Suppose one of the people or one of the prophets or priests asks you, What prophecy has the Lord burdened you with? You must reply, You are the burden! The Lord says he will abandon you! | If any prophet, priest, or anyone else says, I have a prophecy from the Lord, I will punish that person along with his entire family. | You should keep asking each other, What is the Lord’s answer? or What is the Lord saying? | But stop using this phrase, prophecy from the Lord. For people are using it to give authority to their own ideas, turning upside down the words of our God, the living God, the Lord of Heaven’s Armies. | This is what you should say to the prophets: What is the Lord’s answer? or What is the Lord saying? | But suppose they respond, This is a prophecy from the Lord! Then you should say, This is what the Lord says: Because you have used this phrase, prophecy from the Lord, even though I warned you not to use it, | I will forget you completely. I will expel you from my presence, along with this city that I gave to you and your ancestors. | And I will make you an object of ridicule, and your name will be infamous throughout the ages.",

I have become like a drunkard, like a man overcome by wine, because of the Lord, because of his holy words. | For the land is full of adulterers; the land mourns because of the curse, and the grazing lands in the wilderness have dried up.

This is the Lord’s declaration. | Therefore, their way will be to them like slippery paths in the gloom.

Who has paid attention to his word and obeyed? | Look, a storm from the Lord! Wrath has gone out, a whirling storm. It will whirl about the heads of the wicked. | The Lord’s anger will not turn away until he has completely fulfilled the purposes of his heart. In time to come you will understand it clearly. | I did not send these prophets, yet they ran. I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied. | If they had really stood in my council, they would have enabled my people to hear my words and would have turned them from their evil ways and their evil deeds. | Am I a God who is only near—this is the Lord’s declaration—and not a God who is far away? | Can a person hide in secret places where I cannot see him?—the Lord’s declaration. Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?—the Lord’s declaration. | I have heard what the prophets who prophesy a lie in my name have said: I had a dream! I had a dream! | How long will this continue in the minds of the prophets prophesying lies, prophets of the deceit of their own minds? | Through their dreams that they tell one another, they plan to cause my people to forget my name as their ancestors forgot my name through Baal worship. | The prophet who has only a dream should recount the dream, but the one who has my word should speak my word truthfully.

I had a dream! | How long will that continue in the hearts of these prophets who prophesy lies? They are prophets of their own mistaken hearts. | They try to get my people to forget my name. They do it by telling each other dreams their hearts have made up. It is just as their people of long ago forgot my name because of Baal. | Let the prophet who has a dream tell his dream. But let the one who has my message speak it faithfully. Straw is not the same as grain, announces the Lord. | My message is like fire, announces the Lord. It is like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces. | So I am against these prophets, announces the Lord. They steal messages from one another. They claim that the messages came from me. | I am against the prophets, announces the Lord. They use their own words. But they still say, ‘He announces his message through us.’ | I am against those who prophesy false dreams, announces the Lord. They tell their lies and lead my people astray. Their lies are not even helpful to these people, announces the Lord. | Suppose these people or a prophet or priest asks you, What message have you received from the Lord? Then say, You ask, ‘What message?’ Here’s the Lord’s answer. I will desert you. | Suppose a prophet or priest or anyone else claims, ‘Here’s a message from the Lord.’ I will punish them and their family. | Here is what each of you keeps on saying to your friend or relative. You ask, ‘What is the Lord’s answer?’ or, ‘What has the Lord spoken?’ | But you must not talk about a message from the Lord again. That’s because your own words are the messages. And so you twist the words of the living God. He is the Lord who rules over all. He is our God. | Here is what you keep on saying to a prophet. You ask, ‘What answer has the Lord given you?’ or, ‘What has the Lord spoken?’ | But suppose you claim, ‘Here’s a message from the Lord.’ Then the Lord says, ‘You use the words, “Here’s a message from the Lord.” Even though I told you not to use those words, | here is what will happen. I will forget you. I will throw you away from me. I gave this city to your people of long ago. But now I will bring shame on you forever. You will always be dishonored. And it will never be forgotten.’",

      "ChapterText": "¡Ay de los pastores que destruyen y dispersan las ovejas de mi rebaño! —declara el SEÑOR—. Por eso, esto es lo que dice el SEÑOR, el Dios de Israel, a los pastores que cuidan de mi pueblo: “Por cuanto ustedes han dispersado mi rebaño, lo han ahuyentado y no se han preocupado por él, yo me encargaré de castigarles por la maldad que han cometido” —afirma el SEÑOR—. “Yo mismo reuniré el remanente de mi rebaño de todos los países a donde los expulsé y los haré volver a sus pastos, donde serán fecundos y se multiplicarán. Pondré sobre ellos pastores que los cuiden, y ya no temerán ni se asustarán, ni faltará ninguno” —afirma el SEÑOR—. “Vienen días —declara el SEÑOR— en que levantaré para David un retoño justo, un Rey que reinará con sabiduría y hará lo que es justo y correcto en la tierra. En sus días, Judá será salvado e Israel vivirá seguro. Y este es el nombre con el que será llamado: ‘El SEÑOR, nuestra justicia’. Por eso, vienen días —declara el SEÑOR— en que ya no se dirá: ‘Vive el SEÑOR, que sacó a los israelitas de Egipto’, sino que se dirá: ‘Vive el SEÑOR, que sacó a los descendientes de Israel del país del norte y de todos los países a donde los había expulsado’. Entonces vivirán en su propia tierra”.\n\nSobre los profetas: Mi corazón está destrozado dentro de mí; todos mis huesos tiemblan. Estoy como un borracho, como un hombre vencido por el vino, a causa del SEÑOR y de sus santas palabras. La tierra está llena de adúlteros; por causa de la maldición la tierra está seca y los pastos del desierto se han marchitado. Los profetas siguen un camino perverso y abusan de su poder. “Tanto el profeta como el sacerdote son impíos; aun en mi templo encuentro su maldad” —declara el SEÑOR—. “Por eso, su camino será resbaladizo; serán empujados a la oscuridad y allí caerán. Traeré desastre sobre ellos en el año de su castigo” —declara el SEÑOR—. “Entre los profetas de Samaria vi algo repugnante: profetizaban en nombre de Baal y descarriaron a mi pueblo Israel. Y entre los profetas de Jerusalén he visto algo horrible: cometen adulterio y viven en la mentira. Fortalecen las manos de los malhechores, para que nadie se aparte de su maldad. Todos ellos son para mí como Sodoma; los habitantes de Jerusalén son como Gomorra”.\n\nPor eso, esto es lo que dice el SEÑOR Todopoderoso acerca de los profetas: “Les daré de comer comida amarga y de beber agua envenenada, porque de los profetas de Jerusalén se ha extendido la impiedad por toda la tierra”. Así dice el SEÑOR Todopoderoso: “No escuchen a los profetas que les profetizan; les llenan de falsas esperanzas. Hablan visiones de su propia mente, no de la boca del SEÑOR. Siguen diciendo a los que me desprecian: ‘El SEÑOR dice: Tendrán paz’. Y a todos los que siguen la terquedad de su corazón les dicen: ‘No les vendrá ningún mal’. Pero, ¿quién de ellos ha estado en el consejo del SEÑOR para ver o escuchar su palabra? ¿Quién ha prestado atención y ha escuchado su palabra? Miren, la tormenta del SEÑOR estallará con furia, un torbellino que caerá sobre la cabeza de los malvados. La ira del SEÑOR no se apartará hasta que haya cumplido los propósitos de su corazón. En los días venideros lo entenderán claramente. Yo no envié a esos profetas, pero ellos corren a profetizar; no les hablé, pero ellos profetizan. Pero si hubieran estado en mi consejo, habrían proclamado mis palabras a mi pueblo y los habrían hecho volver de su mal camino y de sus malas acciones.\n\n“¿Acaso soy solo un Dios de cerca —declara el SEÑOR— y no también un Dios de lejos? ¿Podrá alguien esconderse en escondites donde yo no lo vea?” —declara el SEÑOR—. “¿Acaso no lleno yo el cielo y la tierra?” —declara el SEÑOR—. “He escuchado lo que dicen los profetas que profetizan mentiras en mi nombre. Dicen: ‘¡Tuve un sueño! ¡Tuve un sueño!’ ¿Hasta cuándo seguirá esto en el corazón de estos profetas mentirosos, que profetizan las ilusiones de su propia mente? Piensan que los sueños que se cuentan unos a otros harán que mi pueblo olvide mi nombre, tal como sus padres olvidaron mi nombre por causa de Baal. Que el profeta que tenga un sueño cuente su sueño, pero el que tenga mi palabra, que la proclame fielmente. ¿Qué tiene que ver la paja con el grano?” —declara el SEÑOR—. “¿No es mi palabra como fuego —declara el SEÑOR— y como un martillo que rompe la roca en pedazos? Por eso —declara el SEÑOR—, estoy contra los profetas que se roban entre sí palabras que supuestamente son mías. Sí —declara el SEÑOR—, estoy contra los profetas que mueven la lengua y dicen: ‘El SEÑOR ha dicho’. En verdad, estoy contra los que profetizan sueños falsos —declara el SEÑOR—. Los cuentan y hacen que mi pueblo se desvíe con sus mentiras irresponsables, aunque yo no los envié ni les di ninguna orden. No benefician en nada a este pueblo” —declara el SEÑOR—.\n\n“Cuando este pueblo, o un profeta o un sacerdote te pregunte: ‘¿Cuál es la carga del SEÑOR?’, respóndeles: ‘¿Qué carga? Los abandonaré, declara el SEÑOR’. Si un profeta, un sacerdote o cualquier otra persona afirma: ‘Esta es la carga del SEÑOR’, castigaré a ese hombre y a su familia. Esto es lo que cada uno de ustedes sigue diciendo a su amigo o pariente: ‘¿Cuál es la respuesta del SEÑOR?’ o ‘¿Qué ha dicho el SEÑOR?’ Pero no mencionen más ‘la carga del SEÑOR’, porque la palabra de cada uno se convierte en su propia carga y así distorsionan las palabras del Dios viviente, el SEÑOR Todopoderoso, nuestro Dios. Esto es lo que siguen diciendo a un profeta: ‘¿Cuál es la respuesta del SEÑOR para ti?’ o ‘¿Qué ha dicho el SEÑOR?’ Aunque ustedes digan: ‘Esta es la carga del SEÑOR’, esto es lo que dice el SEÑOR: Ustedes usan las palabras: ‘Esta es la carga del SEÑOR’, aunque les advertí que no dijeran: ‘Esta es la carga del SEÑOR’. Por eso, los olvidaré por completo y los arrojaré de mi presencia, junto con la ciudad que les di a ustedes y a sus antepasados. Traeré sobre ustedes una vergüenza eterna, una humillación perpetua que nunca será olvidada.”",

Yo traeré sobre ellos el mal, el año de su castigo, dice el SEÑOR. Entre los profetas de Samaria vi cosas indignas: profetizaban en nombre de Baal y extraviaban a mi pueblo Israel. Pero entre los profetas de Jerusalén he visto cosas aún más horribles: adulterio, mentiras, apoyan a los malvados, y nadie se aparta de su maldad.

Con los sueños que se cuentan unos a otros, piensan hacer que mi pueblo olvide mi nombre, igual que sus padres olvidaron mi nombre por Baal.\n\nQue el profeta que tenga un sueño, cuente su sueño; pero el que tenga mi palabra, que hable mi palabra con verdad. ¿Qué tiene que ver la paja con el trigo? —dice el SEÑOR—. ¿No es mi palabra como fuego —dice el SEÑOR—, como un martillo que rompe la roca?\n\nPor eso, estoy contra los profetas —dice el SEÑOR— que se roban mis palabras unos a otros.

      "ChapterText": "I want you to know how much I am struggling for you and for those at Laodicea, and for all who have not met me personally. | My purpose is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding, in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely, Christ, | in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. | I tell you this so that no one may deceive you by fine-sounding arguments. | For though I am absent from you in body, I am present with you in spirit and delight to see how orderly you are and how firm your faith in Christ is. | So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live in him, | rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness. | See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ. | For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form, | and you have been given fullness in Christ, who is the head over every power and authority. | In him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of the sinful nature, not with a circumcision done by the hands of men but with the circumcision done by Christ, | having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead. | When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins, | having canceled the written code, with its regulations, that was against us and that stood opposed to us; he took it away, nailing it to the cross. | And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross. | Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day. | These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ. | Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you for the prize. Such a person goes into great detail about what he has seen, and his unspiritual mind puffs him up with idle notions. | He has lost connection with the Head, from whom the whole body, supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows as God causes it to grow. | Since you died with Christ to the basic principles of this world, why, as though you still belonged to it, do you submit to its rules: | \"Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!\"? | These are all destined to perish with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings. | Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.",

This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. | He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him. | Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath. | These are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ. | Let no one disqualify you, insisting on asceticism and worship of angels, going on in detail about visions, puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind, | and not holding fast to the Head, from whom the whole body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God. | If with Christ you died to the elemental spirits of the world, why, as if you were still alive in the world, do you submit to regulations- | \"Do not handle, Do not taste, Do not touch\" | ( referring to things that all perish as they are used)- according to human precepts and teachings? | These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion and asceticism and severity to the body, but they are of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh.",

      "ChapterText": "Quiero que sepan cuánto lucho por ustedes, por los que están en Laodicea y por todos los que no me conocen personalmente. Mi propósito es que sean animados de corazón y estén unidos en amor, para que tengan toda la riqueza que da el entendimiento completo, y así conozcan el misterio de Dios, es decir, Cristo, en quien están escondidos todos los tesoros de la sabiduría y el conocimiento. Les digo esto para que nadie los engañe con argumentos que suenan bien pero no son verdad. Porque aunque estoy lejos físicamente, estoy con ustedes en espíritu y me alegra ver lo ordenados que son y lo firme que es su fe en Cristo.\n\nAsí que, de la misma manera que recibieron a Cristo Jesús como Señor, sigan viviendo en él, arraigados y edificados en él, fortalecidos en la fe como se les enseñó, y rebosando de gratitud. Tengan cuidado de que nadie los atrape con filosofías huecas y engañosas, que se basan en tradiciones humanas y en los principios básicos de este mundo, y no en Cristo. Porque en Cristo habita corporalmente toda la plenitud de la divinidad, y ustedes han recibido esa plenitud en él, que es la cabeza de todo poder y autoridad.\n\nEn él también fueron circuncidados, no con una circuncisión hecha por manos humanas, sino con la circuncisión que viene de Cristo, al despojarse de la naturaleza pecaminosa. Ustedes fueron sepultados con él en el bautismo y, junto con él, resucitaron mediante la fe en el poder de Dios, que lo resucitó de entre los muertos. Antes, ustedes estaban muertos en sus pecados y en la incircuncisión de su naturaleza pecaminosa, pero Dios les dio vida junto con Cristo. Nos perdonó todos los pecados, anulando el acta de los decretos que nos era contraria y que nos condenaba; la quitó de en medio, clavándola en la cruz. Y desarmó a los poderes y autoridades, y los exhibió públicamente, triunfando sobre ellos por medio de la cruz.\n\nPor eso, que nadie los juzgue por lo que comen o beben, o respecto a días de fiesta religiosa, celebraciones de luna nueva o días de reposo. Todo eso es solo una sombra de lo que ha de venir; la realidad se encuentra en Cristo. No dejen que nadie que se deleita en una falsa humildad y en la adoración de ángeles los prive del premio. Esa gente habla mucho de lo que ha visto, pero su mente carnal los llena de ideas vanas. Han perdido la conexión con la Cabeza, de quien todo el cuerpo, sostenido y unido por ligamentos y articulaciones, crece como Dios quiere que crezca.\n\nYa que ustedes murieron con Cristo a los principios básicos de este mundo, ¿por qué, como si todavía pertenecieran a él, se someten a reglas como: “¡No toques esto! ¡No pruebes aquello! ¡No lo manejes!”? Todas esas cosas están destinadas a desaparecer con el uso, porque se basan en mandamientos y enseñanzas humanas. Estas reglas pueden parecer sabias, con su culto autoimpuesto, su falsa humildad y su duro trato al cuerpo, pero en realidad no tienen valor alguno para dominar los malos deseos.",

      "ChapterText": "Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD, and for seven years he gave them into the hands of the Midianites. | Because the power of Midian was so oppressive, the Israelites prepared shelters for themselves in mountain clefts, caves and strongholds. | Whenever the Israelites planted their crops, the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples invaded the country. | They camped on the land and ruined the crops all the way to Gaza and did not spare a living thing for Israel, neither sheep nor cattle nor donkeys. | They came up with their livestock and their tents like swarms of locusts. It was impossible to count the men and their camels; they invaded the land to ravage it. | Midian so impoverished the Israelites that they cried out to the LORD for help. | When the Israelites cried to the LORD because of Midian, | he sent them a prophet, who said, \"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I brought you up out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. | I snatched you from the power of Egypt and from the hand of all your oppressors. I drove them from before you and gave you their land. | I said to you, 'I am the LORD your God; do not worship the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you live.' But you have not listened to me.\" | The angel of the LORD came and sat down under the oak in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to keep it from the Midianites. | When the angel of the LORD appeared to Gideon, he said, \"The LORD is with you, mighty warrior.\" | \"But sir,\" Gideon replied, \"if the LORD is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonders that our fathers told us about when they said, 'Did not the LORD bring us up out of Egypt?' But now the LORD has abandoned us and put us into the hand of Midian.\" | The LORD turned to him and said, \"Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian's hand. Am I not sending you?\" | \"But Lord, \"Gideon asked, \"how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family.\" | The LORD answered, \"I will be with you, and you will strike down all the Midianites together.\" | Gideon replied, \"If now I have found favor in your eyes, give me a sign that it is really you talking to me. | Please do not go away until I come back and bring my offering and set it before you.\" And the LORD said, \"I will wait until you return.\" | Gideon went in, prepared a young goat, and from an ephah of flour he made bread without yeast. Putting the meat in a basket and its broth in a pot, he brought them out and offered them to him under the oak. | The angel of God said to him, \"Take the meat and the unleavened bread, place them on this rock, and pour out the broth.\" And Gideon did so. | With the tip of the staff that was in his hand, the angel of the LORD touched the meat and the unleavened bread. Fire flared from the rock, consuming the meat and the bread. And the angel of the LORD disappeared. | When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the LORD, he exclaimed, \"Ah, Sovereign LORD! I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face!\" | But the LORD said to him, \"Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die.\" | So Gideon built an altar to the LORD there and called it The LORD is Peace. To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. | That same night the LORD said to him, \"Take the second bull from your father's herd, the one seven years old. Tear down your father's altar to Baal and cut down the Asherah pole beside it. | Then build a proper kind of altar to the LORD your God on the top of this height. Using the wood of the Asherah pole that you cut down, offer the second bull as a burnt offering.\" | So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the LORD told him. But because he was afraid of his family and the men of the town, he did it at night rather than in the daytime. | In the morning when the men of the town got up, there was Baal's altar, demolished, with the Asherah pole beside it cut down and the second bull sacrificed on the newly built altar! | They asked each other, \"Who did this?\" When they carefully investigated, they were told, \"Gideon son of Joash did it.\" | The men of the town demanded of Joash, \"Bring out your son. He must die, because he has broken down Baal's altar and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.\" | But Joash replied to the hostile crowd around him, \"Are you going to plead Baal's cause? Are you trying to save him? Whoever fights for him shall be put to death by morning! If Baal really is a god, he can defend himself when someone breaks down his altar.\" | So that day they called Gideon \"Jerub-Baal, \"saying, \"Let Baal contend with him,\" because he broke down Baal's altar. | Now all the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples joined forces and crossed over the Jordan and camped in the Valley of Jezreel. | Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet, summoning the Abiezrites to follow him. | He sent messengers throughout Manasseh, calling them to arms, and also into Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali, so that they too went up to meet them. | Gideon said to God, \"If you will save Israel by my hand as you have promised- | look, I will place a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry, then I will know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you said.\" | And that is what happened. Gideon rose early the next day; he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew-a bowlful of water. | Then Gideon said to God, \"Do not be angry with me. Let me make just one more request. Allow me one more test with the fleece. This time make the fleece dry and the ground covered with dew.\" | That night God did so. Only the fleece was dry; all the ground was covered with dew.",

      "ChapterText": "The people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD gave them into the hand of Midian seven years. | And the hand of Midian overpowered Israel, and because of Midian the people of Israel made for themselves the dens that are in the mountains and the caves and the strongholds. | For whenever the Israelites planted crops, the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East would come up against them. | They would encamp against them and devour the produce of the land, as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance in Israel and no sheep or ox or donkey. | For they would come up with their livestock and their tents; they would come like locusts in number- both they and their camels could not be counted- so that they laid waste the land as they came in. | And Israel was brought very low because of Midian. And the people of Israel cried out for help to the LORD. | When the people of Israel cried out to the LORD on account of the Midianites, | the LORD sent a prophet to the people of Israel. And he said to them, \"Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I led you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of bondage. | And I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out before you and gave you their land. | And I said to you, 'I am the LORD your God; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell.' But you have not obeyed my voice.\" | Now the angel of the LORD came and sat under the terebinth at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress to hide it from the Midianites. | And the angel of the LORD appeared to him and said to him, \"The LORD is with you, O mighty man of valor.\" | And Gideon said to him, \"Please, sir, if the LORD is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all his wonderful deeds that our fathers recounted to us, saying, 'Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?' But now the LORD has forsaken us and given us into the hand of Midian.\" | And the LORD turned to him and said, \"Go in this might of yours and save Israel from the hand of Midian; do not I send you?\" | And he said to him, \"Please, Lord, how can I save Israel? Behold, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.\" | And the LORD said to him, \"But I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man.\" | And he said to him, \"If now I have found favor in your eyes, then show me a sign that it is you who speaks with me. | Please do not depart from here until I come to you and bring out my present and set it before you.\" And he said, \"I will stay till you return.\" | So Gideon went into his house and prepared a young goat and unleavened cakes from an ephah of flour. The meat he put in a basket, and the broth he put in a pot, and brought them to him under the terebinth and presented them. | And the angel of God said to him, \"Take the meat and the unleavened cakes, and put them on this rock, and pour the broth over them.\" And he did so. | Then the angel of the LORD reached out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes. And fire sprang up from the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. And the angel of the LORD vanished from his sight. | Then Gideon perceived that he was the angel of the LORD. And Gideon said, \"Alas, O Lord GOD! For now I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face.\" | But the LORD said to him, \"Peace be to you. Do not fear; you shall not die.\" | Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD and called it, The LORD is Peace. To this day it still stands at Ophrah, which belongs to the Abiezrites. | That night the LORD said to him, \"Take your father's bull, and the second bull seven years old, and pull down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the Asherah that is beside it | and build an altar to the LORD your God on the top of the stronghold here, with stones laid in due order. Then take the second bull and offer it as a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah that you shall cut down.\" | So Gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the LORD had told him. But because he was too afraid of his family and the men of the town to do it by day, he did it by night. | When the men of the town rose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah beside it was cut down, and the second bull was offered on the altar that had been built. | And they said to one another, \"Who has done this thing?\" And after they had searched and inquired, they said, \"Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.\" | Then the men of the town said to Joash, \"Bring out your son, that he may die, for he has broken down the altar of Baal and cut down the Asherah beside it.\" | But Joash said to all who stood against him, \"Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? Whoever contends for him shall be put to death by morning. If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because his altar has been broken down.\" | Therefore on that day Gideon was called Jerubbaal, that is to say, \"Let Baal contend against him,\" because he broke down his altar. | Now all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East came together, and they crossed the Jordan and encamped in the Valley of Jezreel. | But the Spirit of the LORD clothed Gideon, and he sounded the trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called out to follow him. | And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they too were called out to follow him. And he sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they went up to meet them. | Then Gideon said to God, \"If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said, | behold, I am laying a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece alone, and it is dry on all the ground, then I shall know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said.\" | And it was so. When he rose early next morning and squeezed the fleece, he wrung enough dew from the fleece to fill a bowl with water. | Then Gideon said to God, \"Let not your anger burn against me; let me speak just once more. Please let me test just once more with the fleece. Please let it be dry on the fleece only, and on all the ground let there be dew.\" | And God did so that night; and it was dry on the fleece only, and on all the ground there was dew.",

      "ChapterText": "De nuevo los israelitas hicieron lo malo ante los ojos del SEÑOR, y durante siete años él los entregó en manos de los madianitas. | Como el poder de Madián era tan opresivo, los israelitas se hicieron refugios en las hendiduras de las montañas, en cuevas y en lugares fortificados. | Cada vez que los israelitas sembraban sus cultivos, los madianitas, amalecitas y otros pueblos del oriente invadían el país. | Acampaban en la tierra y destruían las cosechas hasta llegar a Gaza, y no dejaban nada con vida en Israel, ni ovejas, ni ganado, ni burros. | Venían con su ganado y sus carpas como una plaga de langostas. Era imposible contar a los hombres y sus camellos; invadían la tierra para arrasarla. | Madián empobreció tanto a los israelitas que ellos clamaron al SEÑOR pidiendo ayuda. | Cuando los israelitas clamaron al SEÑOR a causa de Madián, | él les envió un profeta, que les dijo: “Así dice el SEÑOR, el Dios de Israel: Yo los saqué de Egipto, de la tierra de esclavitud. | Los libré del poder de Egipto y de todos sus opresores. Los expulsé de delante de ustedes y les di su tierra. | Les dije: ‘Yo soy el SEÑOR su Dios; no adoren a los dioses de los amorreos, en cuya tierra viven.’ Pero ustedes no me obedecieron.” | El ángel del SEÑOR vino y se sentó bajo la encina que estaba en Ofra, que pertenecía a Joás el abiezerita, donde su hijo Gedeón estaba trillando trigo en un lagar para esconderlo de los madianitas. | Cuando el ángel del SEÑOR se le apareció a Gedeón, le dijo: “El SEÑOR está contigo, valiente guerrero.” | “Pero, señor,” respondió Gedeón, “si el SEÑOR está con nosotros, ¿por qué nos pasa todo esto? ¿Dónde están todas sus maravillas de las que nos hablaron nuestros padres, diciendo: ‘¿No nos sacó el SEÑOR de Egipto?’ Pero ahora el SEÑOR nos ha abandonado y nos ha entregado en manos de Madián.” | El SEÑOR se volvió hacia él y le dijo: “Ve con la fuerza que tienes y salva a Israel de manos de Madián. ¿No soy yo quien te envía?” | “Pero, Señor,” preguntó Gedeón, “¿cómo voy a salvar a Israel? Mi clan es el más débil de Manasés, y yo soy el menor de mi familia.” | El SEÑOR le respondió: “Yo estaré contigo, y tú derrotarás a todos los madianitas como si fueran uno solo.” | Gedeón replicó: “Si he hallado gracia ante tus ojos, dame una señal de que realmente eres tú quien me habla. | Por favor, no te vayas hasta que yo vuelva y traiga mi ofrenda y la ponga delante de ti.” Y el SEÑOR le dijo: “Esperaré hasta que regreses.” | Gedeón fue, preparó un cabrito y con una medida de harina hizo pan sin levadura. Puso la carne en una canasta y el caldo en una olla, y se los llevó al ángel bajo la encina y se los ofreció. | El ángel de Dios le dijo: “Toma la carne y el pan sin levadura, ponlos sobre esta roca y derrama el caldo.” Y Gedeón lo hizo así. | Con la punta del bastón que tenía en la mano, el ángel del SEÑOR tocó la carne y el pan sin levadura. Salió fuego de la roca, que consumió la carne y el pan. Y el ángel del SEÑOR desapareció. | Cuando Gedeón se dio cuenta de que era el ángel del SEÑOR, exclamó: “¡Ay, Señor Soberano! ¡He visto al ángel del SEÑOR cara a cara!” | Pero el SEÑOR le dijo: “¡Tranquilo! No tengas miedo. No vas a morir.” | Así que Gedeón construyó allí un altar al SEÑOR y lo llamó “El SEÑOR es Paz”. Hasta hoy está en Ofra de los abiezeritas. | Esa misma noche el SEÑOR le dijo: “Toma el segundo toro del rebaño de tu padre, el que tiene siete años. Derriba el altar de Baal que tiene tu padre y corta la imagen de Asera que está junto a él. | Luego construye un altar apropiado al SEÑOR tu Dios en la cima de este lugar. Usa la madera de la imagen de Asera que cortaste para ofrecer el segundo toro en holocausto.” | Así que Gedeón tomó a diez de sus siervos e hizo lo que el SEÑOR le había dicho. Pero, como tenía miedo de su familia y de los hombres del pueblo, lo hizo de noche y no de día. | Por la mañana, cuando los hombres del pueblo se levantaron, vieron que el altar de Baal estaba derribado, la imagen de Asera cortada y el segundo toro sacrificado en el altar recién construido. | Se preguntaron unos a otros: “¿Quién hizo esto?” Después de investigar bien, les dijeron: “Lo hizo Gedeón, hijo de Joás.” | Los hombres del pueblo le dijeron a Joás: “Saca a tu hijo. Debe morir, porque ha derribado el altar de Baal y ha cortado la imagen de Asera que estaba junto a él.” | Pero Joás respondió a la multitud hostil que lo rodeaba: “¿Van a defender la causa de Baal? ¿Van a salvarlo ustedes? ¡El que luche por él será ejecutado al amanecer! Si Baal es realmente un dios, que se defienda él mismo cuando alguien derribe su altar.” | Por eso, ese día llamaron a Gedeón “Jerobaal”, diciendo: “Que Baal contienda con él”, porque derribó su altar. | Entonces todos los madianitas, amalecitas y otros pueblos del oriente se unieron, cruzaron el Jordán y acamparon en el valle de Jezreel. | Entonces el Espíritu del SEÑOR vino sobre Gedeón, y él tocó la trompeta, convocando a los abiezeritas para que lo siguieran. | Envió mensajeros por todo Manasés, llamándolos a las armas, y también a Aser, Zabulón y Neftalí, para que subieran a encontrarse con él. | Gedeón le dijo a Dios: “Si vas a salvar a Israel por mi mano, como lo has prometido, | mira, voy a poner un vellón de lana en la era. Si el rocío cae solo sobre el vellón y todo el suelo queda seco, sabré que salvarás a Israel por mi mano, como dijiste.” | Y así fue. Gedeón se levantó temprano al día siguiente, exprimió el vellón y sacó de él un tazón lleno de agua. | Luego Gedeón le dijo a Dios: “No te enojes conmigo. Permíteme hacerte una petición más. Déjame hacer una prueba más con el vellón. Esta vez haz que solo el vellón quede seco y que todo el suelo esté cubierto de rocío.” | Esa noche Dios lo hizo así. Solo el vellón quedó seco, mientras que todo el suelo estaba cubierto de rocío.",

      "ChapterText": "Los israelitas hicieron lo malo ante los ojos del SEÑOR, y el SEÑOR los entregó en manos de los madianitas durante siete años. Los madianitas oprimieron tanto a Israel que, por causa de ellos, los israelitas se hicieron escondites en las montañas, cuevas y lugares fortificados. Cada vez que los israelitas sembraban, venían los madianitas, los amalecitas y los pueblos del oriente y los atacaban. Acampaban contra ellos y destruían los frutos de la tierra hasta llegar a Gaza, y no dejaban nada para comer en Israel, ni ovejas, ni bueyes, ni asnos. Venían con su ganado y sus tiendas, y eran tantos como langostas; tanto ellos como sus camellos eran incontables, y así arrasaban la tierra por donde pasaban. Por culpa de Madián, Israel quedó totalmente arruinado, y los israelitas clamaron al SEÑOR pidiendo ayuda.\n\nCuando los israelitas clamaron al SEÑOR por causa de los madianitas, el SEÑOR les envió un profeta, que les dijo: “Así dice el SEÑOR, Dios de Israel: Yo los saqué de Egipto y los libré de la esclavitud. Los rescaté del poder de los egipcios y de todos los que los oprimían; los expulsé de delante de ustedes y les di su tierra. Les dije: ‘Yo soy el SEÑOR su Dios; no teman a los dioses de los amorreos, en cuya tierra habitan.’ Pero ustedes no me obedecieron.”\n\nEntonces el ángel del SEÑOR vino y se sentó bajo la encina que estaba en Ofra, que pertenecía a Joás el abiezerita. Su hijo Gedeón estaba sacudiendo trigo en un lagar para esconderlo de los madianitas. El ángel del SEÑOR se le apareció y le dijo: “El SEÑOR está contigo, valiente guerrero.” Gedeón le respondió: “Por favor, señor, si el SEÑOR está con nosotros, ¿por qué nos pasa todo esto? ¿Dónde están todas las maravillas que nuestros padres nos contaron, diciendo: ‘¿No nos sacó el SEÑOR de Egipto?’ Pero ahora el SEÑOR nos ha abandonado y nos ha entregado en manos de Madián.”\n\nEl SEÑOR lo miró y le dijo: “Ve con la fuerza que tienes y salva a Israel del poder de Madián. ¿No soy yo quien te envía?” Gedeón le respondió: “Por favor, Señor, ¿cómo voy a salvar a Israel? Mi clan es el más débil de Manasés, y yo soy el menor de la casa de mi padre.” El SEÑOR le dijo: “Yo estaré contigo, y derrotarás a los madianitas como si fueran un solo hombre.” Gedeón le dijo: “Si he hallado gracia ante tus ojos, dame una señal de que eres tú quien me habla. Te ruego que no te vayas de aquí hasta que vuelva y te traiga mi ofrenda y la ponga delante de ti.” El ángel le respondió: “Me quedaré hasta que regreses.”\n\nGedeón fue a su casa, preparó un cabrito y panes sin levadura con una medida de harina. Puso la carne en una canasta y el caldo en una olla, y los llevó bajo la encina y se los presentó. El ángel de Dios le dijo: “Toma la carne y los panes sin levadura, ponlos sobre esta roca y vierte el caldo encima.” Así lo hizo. Entonces el ángel del SEÑOR extendió la punta del bastón que tenía en la mano, tocó la carne y los panes sin levadura, y de la roca salió fuego que consumió la carne y los panes. Y el ángel del SEÑOR desapareció de su vista.\n\nGedeón se dio cuenta de que era el ángel del SEÑOR y exclamó: “¡Ay de mí, Señor DIOS! ¡He visto al ángel del SEÑOR cara a cara!” Pero el SEÑOR le dijo: “Paz a ti. No temas, no morirás.” Entonces Gedeón construyó allí un altar al SEÑOR y lo llamó “El SEÑOR es Paz”. Hasta hoy está en Ofra, de los abiezeritas.\n\nEsa noche el SEÑOR le dijo: “Toma el toro de tu padre y otro toro de siete años, derriba el altar de Baal que tiene tu padre y corta la imagen de Asera que está junto a él. Luego construye un altar al SEÑOR tu Dios en la cima de este lugar fuerte, en el orden debido. Toma el segundo toro y ofrécelo en holocausto con la leña de la imagen de Asera que cortaste.” Gedeón tomó a diez de sus siervos e hizo lo que el SEÑOR le había mandado. Pero, como tenía miedo de su familia y de los hombres del pueblo, lo hizo de noche y no de día.\n\nPor la mañana, cuando los hombres del pueblo se levantaron, vieron que el altar de Baal estaba derribado, la imagen de Asera cortada y el segundo toro ofrecido en el altar recién construido. Se preguntaron unos a otros: “¿Quién hizo esto?” Después de investigar, dijeron: “Gedeón, hijo de Joás, lo hizo.” Entonces los hombres del pueblo le dijeron a Joás: “Saca a tu hijo para que muera, porque ha derribado el altar de Baal y ha cortado la imagen de Asera que estaba junto a él.” Pero Joás respondió a todos los que lo enfrentaban: “¿Van a defender ustedes a Baal? ¿Van a salvarlo? El que luche por él, morirá antes de que amanezca. Si Baal es un dios, que él mismo se defienda, ya que han derribado su altar.” Por eso, aquel día llamaron a Gedeón Jerobaal, diciendo: “Que Baal contienda contra él, porque derribó su altar.”\n\nEntonces todos los madianitas, amalecitas y los pueblos del oriente se reunieron, cruzaron el Jordán y acamparon en el valle de Jezreel. Pero el Espíritu del SEÑOR vino sobre Gedeón, quien tocó la trompeta, y los abiezeritas se unieron para seguirlo. Envió mensajeros por todo Manasés, que también se unió a él, y envió mensajeros a Aser, Zabulón y Neftalí, y ellos también subieron a encontrarse con él.\n\nGedeón le dijo a Dios: “Si vas a salvar a Israel por mi mano, como has dicho, voy a poner un vellón de lana en la era. Si el rocío está solo en el vellón y todo el suelo alrededor está seco, sabré que salvarás a Israel por mi mano, como has dicho.” Y así fue. Al día siguiente, Gedeón se levantó temprano, exprimió el vellón y sacó suficiente rocío como para llenar un tazón de agua. Entonces Gedeón le dijo a Dios: “No te enojes conmigo si te pido una vez más. Permíteme hacer una prueba más con el vellón: que ahora solo el vellón quede seco y que haya rocío en todo el suelo.” Y esa noche Dios lo hizo así: solo el vellón quedó seco, y en todo el suelo había rocío.",

I am like one who gathers summer fruit at the gleaning of the vineyard; there is no cluster of grapes to eat, none of the early figs that I crave. | The godly have been swept from the land; not one upright man remains. All men lie in wait to shed blood; each hunts his brother with a net. | Both hands are skilled in doing evil; the ruler demands gifts, the judge accepts bribes, the powerful dictate what they desire- they all conspire together. | The best of them is like a brier, the most upright worse than a thorn hedge. The day of your watchmen has come, the day God visits you. Now is the time of their confusion. | Do not trust a neighbor; put no confidence in a friend. Even with her who lies in your embrace be careful of your words. | For a son dishonors his father, a daughter rises up against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law- a man's enemies are the members of his own household. | But as for me, I watch in hope for the LORD, I wait for God my Savior; my God will hear me. | Do not gloat over me, my enemy! Though I have fallen, I will rise. Though I sit in darkness, the LORD will be my light. | Because I have sinned against him, I will bear the LORD's wrath, until he pleads my case and establishes my right. He will bring me out into the light; I will see his righteousness. | Then my enemy will see it and will be covered with shame, she who said to me, \"Where is the LORD your God?\" My eyes will see her downfall; even now she will be trampled underfoot like mire in the streets. | The day for building your walls will come, the day for extending your boundaries. | In that day people will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, even from Egypt to the Euphrates and from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain. | The earth will become desolate because of its inhabitants, as the result of their deeds. | Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock of your inheritance, which lives by itself in a forest, in fertile pasturelands. Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead as in days long ago. | \"As in the days when you came out of Egypt, I will show them my wonders.\" | Nations will see and be ashamed, deprived of all their power. They will lay their hands on their mouths and their ears will become deaf. | They will lick dust like a snake, like creatures that crawl on the ground. They will come trembling out of their dens; they will turn in fear to the LORD our God and will be afraid of you. | Who is a God like you, who pardons sin and forgives the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance? You do not stay angry forever but delight to show mercy. | You will again have compassion on us; you will tread our sins underfoot and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea. | You will be true to Jacob, and show mercy to Abraham, as you pledged on oath to our fathers in days long ago.",

Soy como quien recoge frutos de verano después de la cosecha de la viña; no hay racimos de uvas para comer, ni higos tempranos que tanto deseo. | Los justos han desaparecido de la tierra; no queda ni un hombre recto. Todos acechan para derramar sangre; cada uno caza a su hermano con una red. | Ambas manos son expertas para hacer el mal; el gobernante exige regalos, el juez acepta sobornos, los poderosos imponen lo que quieren; todos conspiran juntos. | El mejor de ellos es como un espino, el más recto peor que una cerca de zarzas. Ha llegado el día de tus centinelas, el día en que Dios te visita. Ahora es el tiempo de su confusión. | No confíes en tu vecino; no pongas tu confianza en un amigo. Ni siquiera con la que duerme a tu lado hables sin cuidado. | Porque el hijo desprecia a su padre, la hija se levanta contra su madre, la nuera contra su suegra; los enemigos de un hombre son los de su propia casa. | Pero yo, en cambio, espero en el SEÑOR, aguardo al Dios de mi salvación; mi Dios me escuchará. | ¡No te alegres de mí, enemiga mía! Aunque haya caído, me levantaré. Aunque habite en tinieblas, el SEÑOR será mi luz. | Porque pequé contra él, soportaré la ira del SEÑOR, hasta que defienda mi causa y haga justicia por mí. Él me sacará a la luz; veré su justicia. | Entonces mi enemiga lo verá y quedará avergonzada, ella que me decía: “¿Dónde está el SEÑOR tu Dios?” Mis ojos la verán derrotada; ahora será pisoteada como lodo en las calles. | Vendrá el día de reconstruir tus muros, el día de extender tus fronteras. | Ese día vendrán a ti desde Asiria y las ciudades de Egipto, desde Egipto hasta el Éufrates, de mar a mar y de montaña a montaña. | La tierra quedará desolada por culpa de sus habitantes, como resultado de sus acciones. | Apacienta a tu pueblo con tu cayado, el rebaño de tu heredad, que vive apartado en el bosque, en fértiles pastizales. Déjalos pastar en Basán y Galaad como en tiempos antiguos. | “Como en los días en que saliste de Egipto, les mostraré maravillas.” | Las naciones verán y se avergonzarán, privadas de todo su poder. Se taparán la boca con las manos y sus oídos quedarán sordos. | Lamerán el polvo como serpientes, como animales que se arrastran por la tierra. Saldrán temblando de sus escondites; se volverán con temor al SEÑOR nuestro Dios y temerán ante ti. | ¿Qué Dios hay como tú, que perdona el pecado y olvida la transgresión del remanente de su heredad? No guardas tu enojo para siempre, sino que te complaces en mostrar misericordia. | Volverás a compadecerte de nosotros; pisotearás nuestras iniquidades y arrojarás todos nuestros pecados a las profundidades del mar. | Serás fiel a Jacob y mostrarás tu amor a Abraham, como juraste a nuestros padres en tiempos antiguos.",

Porque he quedado como cuando ya se ha recogido la fruta de verano, como cuando ya se han rebuscado las uvas: no queda racimo para comer, ni higo temprano que mi alma desea. | Los justos han desaparecido de la tierra, y no queda nadie recto entre los hombres; todos acechan para derramar sangre, cada uno caza a su hermano con una red. | Sus manos están listas para hacer el mal; el príncipe y el juez piden soborno, y el grande expresa el mal deseo de su alma; así juntos lo traman. | El mejor de ellos es como un espino, el más recto es como un seto de espinas. Ya llegó el día de tus centinelas, el día de tu castigo; ahora será su confusión. | No confíes en tu prójimo; no tengas confianza en tu amigo; cuida lo que dices incluso a la que duerme en tus brazos; | porque el hijo desprecia al padre, la hija se levanta contra su madre, la nuera contra su suegra; los enemigos de un hombre son los de su propia casa. | Pero yo miraré al SEÑOR; esperaré en el Dios de mi salvación; mi Dios me escuchará. | No te alegres de mí, enemiga mía; aunque caiga, me levantaré; aunque habite en tinieblas, el SEÑOR será mi luz. | Soportaré la ira del SEÑOR porque pequé contra él, hasta que defienda mi causa y haga justicia por mí. Él me sacará a la luz, y veré su justicia. | Entonces mi enemiga lo verá, y la cubrirá la vergüenza, la que me decía: “¿Dónde está el SEÑOR tu Dios?” Mis ojos la verán; ahora será pisoteada como el lodo de las calles. | ¡Viene el día para reconstruir tus muros! Ese día se extenderán tus fronteras. | Ese día vendrán a ti desde Asiria y las ciudades de Egipto, y desde Egipto hasta el río, de mar a mar y de monte a monte. | Pero la tierra quedará desolada por culpa de sus habitantes, por el fruto de sus acciones. | Apacienta a tu pueblo con tu cayado, el rebaño de tu heredad, que vive solo en el bosque, en medio de un campo fértil; que pasten en Basán y Galaad como en los días antiguos. | Como en los días en que saliste de Egipto, les mostraré maravillas. | Las naciones verán y se avergonzarán de todo su poder; se taparán la boca con la mano, sus oídos quedarán sordos; | lamerán el polvo como la serpiente, como los reptiles de la tierra; saldrán temblando de sus escondites, se volverán con temor al SEÑOR nuestro Dios, y temerán ante ti. | ¿Qué Dios hay como tú, que perdona la maldad y olvida el pecado del remanente de su heredad? No retiene para siempre su enojo, porque se complace en la misericordia. | Volverá a compadecerse de nosotros; pisoteará nuestras iniquidades. Arrojarás todos nuestros pecados a lo profundo del mar. | Cumplirás tu fidelidad a Jacob y tu amor a Abraham, como juraste a nuestros padres desde tiempos antiguos.",

But the crops you have gathered are small. You eat, but you never have enough. You drink, but you are never full. You put on clothes, but you are not warm. You earn your pay. But it will not buy everything you need.” | He continues, “Think carefully about how you are living. | Go up into the mountains. Bring logs down. Use them to rebuild my house. Then I will enjoy it. And you will honor me,” says the Lord. | “You expected a lot. But you can see what a small amount it turned out to be. When you brought it home, I blew it away. Why? Because my house is still destroyed. In spite of that, each one of you is busy with your own house. | So because of what you have done, the heavens have held back the dew. And the earth has not produced its crops. | I sent a drought on your fields and mountains. It struck your grain and new wine. It struck your olive oil and everything else the ground produces. It struck your livestock and the work of your hands.” | Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua, the high priest, began to obey the Lord their God. So did all the Lord’s people who were still left alive. They obeyed the message of the Lord their God. They obeyed what the prophet Haggai said. That’s because the Lord their God had sent him. And the people had respect for the Lord. | Haggai was the Lord’s messenger. So he gave the message of the Lord to the people. He told them, “The Lord announces, ‘I am with you.’ ” | So the Lord stirred up the spirits of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and Joshua, the high priest. He also stirred up the spirits of all the Lord’s people who were still left alive. They came and began to work on the Lord’s temple. He is the God who rules over all.

They were sons of Rimmon, a member of the tribe of Benjamin who lived in Beeroth. The town of Beeroth is now part of Benjamin’s territory | because the original people of Beeroth fled to Gittaim, where they still live as foreigners. | (Saul’s son Jonathan had a son named Mephibosheth, who was crippled as a child. He was five years old when the report came from Jezreel that Saul and Jonathan had been killed in battle. When the child’s nurse heard the news, she picked him up and fled. But as she hurried away, she dropped him, and he became crippled.) | One day Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon from Beeroth, went to Ishbosheth’s house around noon as he was taking his midday rest. | The doorkeeper, who had been sifting wheat, became drowsy and fell asleep. So Rechab and Baanah slipped past her. | They went into the house and found Ishbosheth sleeping on his bed. They struck and killed him and cut off his head. Then, taking his head with them, they fled across the Jordan Valley through the night. | When they arrived at Hebron, they presented Ishbosheth’s head to David. \"Look!\" they exclaimed to the king. \"Here is the head of Ishbosheth, the son of your enemy Saul, who tried to kill you. Today the Lord has given my lord the king revenge on Saul and his entire family!\" | But David said to Rechab and Baanah, \"As surely as the Lord lives, who has saved me from all my enemies,\" | \"once someone told me, ‘Saul is dead,’ thinking he was bringing me good news. But I seized him and killed him at Ziklag. That is the reward I gave him for his news!\" | \"How much more should I reward evil men who have killed an innocent man in his own house and on his own bed? Shouldn’t I hold you responsible for his blood and rid the earth of you?\" | So David ordered his young men to kill them, and they did. They cut off their hands and feet and hung their bodies beside the pool in Hebron. Then they took Ishbosheth’s head and buried it in Abner’s tomb in Hebron.",

His mother's name was Jecoliah; she was from Jerusalem. | He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Amaziah had done. | He sought God during the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear of God. As long as he sought the LORD, God gave him success. | He went to war against the Philistines and broke down the walls of Gath, Jabneh and Ashdod. He then rebuilt towns near Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines. | God helped him against the Philistines and against the Arabs who lived in Gur Baal and against the Meunites. | The Ammonites brought tribute to Uzziah, and his fame spread as far as the border of Egypt, because he had become very powerful. | Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate and at the angle of the wall, and he fortified them. | He also built towers in the desert and dug many cisterns, because he had much livestock in the foothills and in the plain. He had people working his fields and vineyards in the hills and in the fertile lands, for he loved the soil. | Uzziah had a well-trained army, ready to go out by divisions according to their numbers as mustered by Jeiel the secretary and Maaseiah the officer under the direction of Hananiah, one of the royal officials. | The total number of family leaders over the fighting men was 2,600. | Under their command was an army of 307,500 men trained for war, a powerful force to support the king against his enemies. | Uzziah provided shields, spears, helmets, coats of armor, bows and slingstones for the entire army. | In Jerusalem he made machines designed by skillful men for use on the towers and on the corner defenses to shoot arrows and hurl large stones. His fame spread far and wide, for he was greatly helped until he became powerful. | But after Uzziah became powerful, his pride led to his downfall. He was unfaithful to the LORD his God, and entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense. | Azariah the priest with eighty other courageous priests of the LORD followed him in. | They confronted him and said, \"It is not right for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD. That is for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who have been consecrated to burn incense. Leave the sanctuary, for you have been unfaithful; and you will not be honored by the LORD God.\" | Uzziah, who had a censer in his hand ready to burn incense, became angry. While he was raging at the priests in their presence before the incense altar in the LORD's temple, leprosy broke out on his forehead. | When Azariah the chief priest and all the other priests looked at him, they saw that he had leprosy on his forehead, so they hurried him out. Indeed, he himself was eager to leave, because the LORD had afflicted him. | King Uzziah had leprosy until the day he died. He lived in a separate house -leprous, and excluded from the temple of the LORD. Jotham his son had charge of the palace and governed the people of the land. | The other events of Uzziah's reign, from beginning to end, are recorded by the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. | Uzziah rested with his fathers and was buried near them in a field for burial that belonged to the kings, for people said, \"He had leprosy.\" And Jotham his son succeeded him as king.",

And as long as the king sought guidance from the Lord, God gave him success. | Uzziah declared war on the Philistines and broke down the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod. Then he built new towns in the Ashdod area and in other parts of Philistia. | God helped him in his wars against the Philistines, his battles with the Arabs of Gur, and his wars with the Meunites. | The Meunites paid annual tribute to him, and his fame spread even to Egypt, for he had become very powerful. | Uzziah built fortified towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and at the angle in the wall. He also constructed forts in the wilderness and dug many water cisterns, because he kept great herds of livestock in the foothills of Judah and on the plains. He was also a man who loved the soil. He had many workers who cared for his farms and vineyards, both on the hillsides and in the fertile valleys. | Uzziah had a well-organized army, ready to march out to battle unit by unit. This army had been mustered and organized by Jeiel, the secretary of the army, and his assistant, Maaseiah.

He sinned against the Lord his God by entering the sanctuary of the Lord’s Temple and personally burning incense on the incense altar. | Azariah the high priest went in after him with eighty other priests of the Lord, all brave men. | They confronted King Uzziah and said, “It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the Lord. That is the work of the priests alone, the descendants of Aaron, who are set apart for this work. Get out of the sanctuary, for you have sinned. The Lord God will not honor you for this!” | Uzziah, who was holding an incense burner, became furious. But as he was standing there raging at the priests before the incense altar in the Lord’s Temple, leprosy suddenly broke out on his forehead. | When Azariah and the other priests saw the leprosy, they rushed him out. And the king himself was eager to get out because the Lord had struck him. | So King Uzziah had leprosy until the day he died. He lived in isolation in a separate house, for he was excluded from the Temple of the Lord. His son Jotham was put in charge of the royal palace, and he governed the people of the land. | The rest of the events of Uzziah’s reign, from beginning to end, are recorded by the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. | When Uzziah died, he was buried with his ancestors; his grave was in a nearby burial field belonging to the kings, for the people said, “He had leprosy.” And his son Jotham became the next king.",

      "ChapterText": "Entonces todo el pueblo de Judá tomó a Uzías, que tenía dieciséis años, y lo hizo rey en lugar de su padre Amasías. Él fue quien reconstruyó Elat y la devolvió a Judá después de que Amasías descansó con sus antepasados. Uzías tenía dieciséis años cuando comenzó a reinar, y reinó en Jerusalén cincuenta y dos años. Su madre se llamaba Jecolía y era de Jerusalén. Uzías hizo lo que era correcto ante los ojos del SEÑOR, igual que su padre Amasías. Buscó a Dios durante los días de Zacarías, quien lo instruyó en el temor de Dios. Mientras buscó al SEÑOR, Dios le dio éxito.\n\nFue a la guerra contra los filisteos y derribó los muros de Gat, Jabné y Asdod. Luego reconstruyó ciudades cerca de Asdod y en otras partes entre los filisteos. Dios lo ayudó contra los filisteos, contra los árabes que vivían en Gur Baal y contra los meunitas. Los amonitas le pagaban tributo a Uzías, y su fama se extendió hasta la frontera de Egipto, porque se había hecho muy poderoso.\n\nUzías construyó torres en Jerusalén, en la Puerta de la Esquina, en la Puerta del Valle y en el ángulo del muro, y las fortificó. También construyó torres en el desierto y cavó muchas cisternas, porque tenía mucho ganado en las colinas y en la llanura. Tenía gente trabajando en sus campos y viñedos en las colinas y en las tierras fértiles, porque amaba la agricultura.\n\nUzías tenía un ejército bien entrenado, listo para salir en divisiones según el número de hombres contados por Jeiel, el secretario, y por Maasías, el oficial, bajo la dirección de Hananías, uno de los funcionarios del rey. El número total de jefes de familia al mando de los guerreros era de 2,600. Bajo su mando había un ejército de 307,500 hombres entrenados para la guerra, una fuerza poderosa para apoyar al rey contra sus enemigos. Uzías proveyó escudos, lanzas, cascos, corazas, arcos y piedras para honda para todo el ejército.\n\nEn Jerusalén hizo máquinas diseñadas por expertos para usarlas en las torres y en las esquinas de las murallas, para lanzar flechas y grandes piedras. Su fama se extendió por todas partes, porque fue grandemente ayudado hasta que se hizo poderoso.\n\nPero cuando Uzías se hizo poderoso, su orgullo lo llevó a la ruina. Fue infiel al SEÑOR su Dios y entró en el templo del SEÑOR para quemar incienso en el altar del incienso. El sacerdote Azarías, junto con ochenta valientes sacerdotes del SEÑOR, lo siguieron. Lo enfrentaron y le dijeron: \"No te corresponde a ti, Uzías, quemar incienso al SEÑOR. Eso es para los sacerdotes, descendientes de Aarón, que han sido consagrados para quemar incienso. Sal del santuario, porque has sido infiel; y no serás honrado por el SEÑOR Dios\".\n\nUzías, que tenía un incensario en la mano listo para quemar incienso, se enojó. Mientras les gritaba a los sacerdotes delante del altar del incienso en el templo del SEÑOR, la lepra le brotó en la frente. Cuando Azarías, el sumo sacerdote, y los demás sacerdotes lo vieron, notaron que tenía lepra en la frente, así que lo sacaron rápidamente. De hecho, él mismo tenía prisa por salir, porque el SEÑOR lo había herido.\n\nEl rey Uzías tuvo lepra hasta el día de su muerte. Vivió en una casa separada, leproso y excluido del templo del SEÑOR. Jotam, su hijo, se encargó del palacio y gobernaba al pueblo de la tierra. Los demás hechos del reinado de Uzías, desde el principio hasta el fin, están escritos por el profeta Isaías, hijo de Amoz.\n\nUzías descansó con sus antepasados y fue enterrado cerca de ellos en un campo de sepultura que pertenecía a los reyes, porque decían: \"Tenía lepra\". Y Jotam, su hijo, reinó en su lugar.",

Uzías tenía dieciséis años cuando se convirtió en rey y reinó cincuenta y dos años en Jerusalén. Su madre, Jecolía, era de Jerusalén. Uzías hizo lo que agradaba al SEÑOR, igual que su padre Amasías. Mientras vivió Zacarías, quien le enseñó a temer a Dios, Uzías buscó al SEÑOR, y mientras lo buscó, Dios lo hizo prosperar.\n\nUzías salió a pelear contra los filisteos y derribó los muros de Gat, Jabné y Asdod; además, construyó ciudades en la región de Asdod y en Filistea.

Uzías les proveyó a todos—al ejército completo—escudos, lanzas, cascos, corazas, arcos y piedras para hondas.\n\nTambién construyó en Jerusalén máquinas diseñadas para colocarse en las torres y en las esquinas de los muros, para lanzar flechas y grandes piedras. Su fama se extendió por todas partes, y su poder se atribuía a la ayuda maravillosa que había recibido.\n\nPero cuando Uzías se hizo fuerte, se llenó de orgullo y eso lo llevó a su ruina.

She put him and his nurse in a bedroom to hide him from Athaliah; so he was not killed. | He remained hidden with his nurse at the temple of the LORD for six years while Athaliah ruled the land. | In the seventh year Jehoiada sent for the commanders of units of a hundred, the Carites and the guards and had them brought to him at the temple of the LORD. He made a covenant with them and put them under oath at the temple of the LORD. Then he showed them the king's son. | He commanded them, saying, \"This is what you are to do: You who are in the three companies that are going on duty on the Sabbath-a third of you guarding the royal palace, | a third at the Sur Gate, and a third at the gate behind the guard, who take turns guarding the temple- | and you who are in the other two companies that normally go off Sabbath duty are all to guard the temple for the king. | Station yourselves around the king, each man with his weapon in his hand. Anyone who approaches your ranks must be put to death. Stay close to the king wherever he goes.\" | The commanders of units of a hundred did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered. Each one took his men-those who were going on duty on the Sabbath and those who were going off duty-and came to Jehoiada the priest. | Then he gave the commanders the spears and shields that had belonged to King David and that were in the temple of the LORD. | The guards, each with his weapon in his hand, stationed themselves around the king-near the altar and the temple, from the south side to the north side of the temple. | Jehoiada brought out the king's son and put the crown on him; he presented him with a copy of the covenant and proclaimed him king. They anointed him, and the people clapped their hands and shouted, \"Long live the king!\" | When Athaliah heard the noise made by the guards and the people, she went to the people at the temple of the LORD. | She looked and there was the king, standing by the pillar, as the custom was. The officers and the trumpeters were beside the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her robes and called out, \"Treason! Treason!\" | Jehoiada the priest ordered the commanders of units of a hundred, who were in charge of the troops: \"Bring her out between the ranks and put to the sword anyone who follows her.\" For the priest had said, \"She must not be put to death in the temple of the LORD.\" | So they seized her as she reached the place where the horses enter the palace grounds, and there she was put to death. | Jehoiada then made a covenant between the LORD and the king and people that they would be the LORD's people. He also made a covenant between the king and the people. | All the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols to pieces and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars. Then Jehoiada the priest posted guards at the temple of the LORD. | He took with him the commanders of hundreds, the Carites, the guards and all the people of the land, and together they brought the king down from the temple of the LORD and went into the palace, entering by way of the gate of the guards. The king then took his place on the royal throne, | and all the people of the land rejoiced. And the city was quiet, because Athaliah had been slain with the sword at the palace. | Joash was seven years old when he began to reign.",

And he made a covenant with them and took an oath from them in the house of the Lord, and showed them the king’s son. | Then he commanded them, saying, “This is what you shall do: One-third of you who come on duty on the Sabbath shall be keeping watch over the king’s house, | one-third shall be at the gate of Sur, and one-third at the gate behind the escorts; you shall keep the watch of the house, lest it be broken down. | The two contingents of you who go off duty on the Sabbath shall keep the watch of the house of the Lord for the king. | But you shall surround the king on all sides, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever comes within range, let him be put to death. You are to be with the king as he goes out and as he comes in.” | So the captains of the hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. Each of them took his men who were to be on duty on the Sabbath, with those who were going off duty on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest. | And the priest gave the captains of hundreds the spears and shields which had belonged to King David, that were in the temple of the Lord. | Then the escorts stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, all around the king, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, by the altar and the house. | And he brought out the king’s son, put the crown on him, and gave him the Testimony; they made him king and anointed him, and they clapped their hands and said, “Long live the king!” | Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the escorts and the people, she came to the people in the temple of the Lord. | When she looked, there was the king standing by a pillar according to custom; and the leaders and the trumpeters were by the king. All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. So Athaliah tore her clothes and cried out, “Treason! Treason!” | And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the army, and said to them, “Take her outside under guard, and slay with the sword whoever follows her.” For the priest had said, “Do not let her be killed in the house of the Lord.” | So they seized her; and she went by way of the horses’ entrance into the king’s house, and there she was killed. | Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the Lord, the king, and the people, that they should be the Lord’s people, and also between the king and the people. | And all the people of the land went to the temple of Baal, and tore it down. They thoroughly broke in pieces its altars and images, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the Lord. | Then he took the captains of hundreds, the bodyguards, the escorts, and all the people of the land; and they brought the king down from the house of the Lord, and went by way of the gate of the escorts to the king’s house.

She put Joash and his nurse in a bedroom, and they hid him from Athaliah, so the child was not murdered. | Joash remained hidden in the Temple of the Lord for six years while Athaliah ruled over the land. | In the seventh year of Athaliah’s reign, Jehoiada the priest summoned the commanders, the Carite mercenaries, and the palace guards to come to the Temple of the Lord. He made a solemn pact with them and made them swear an oath of loyalty there in the Lord’s Temple; then he showed them the king’s son. | Jehoiada told them, “This is what you must do.

They formed a line from the south side of the Temple around to the north side and all around the altar. | Then Jehoiada brought out Joash, the king’s son, placed the crown on his head, and presented him with a copy of God’s laws. They anointed him and proclaimed him king, and everyone clapped their hands and shouted, “Long live the king!” | When Athaliah heard the noise made by the palace guards and the people, she hurried to the Lord’s Temple to see what was happening. | When she arrived, she saw the newly crowned king standing in his place of authority by the pillar, as was the custom at times of coronation. The commanders and trumpeters were surrounding him, and people from all over the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. Athaliah tore her clothes and shouted, “Treason! Treason!” | Then Jehoiada the priest ordered the commanders who were in charge of the troops, “Take her to the soldiers in front of the Temple, and kill anyone who tries to rescue her.” For the priest had said, “She must not be killed in the Temple of the Lord.” | So they seized her and led her out to the gate where horses enter the palace grounds, and she was killed there. | Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the Lord and the king and the people that they would be the Lord’s people. He also made a covenant between the king and the people. | Then all the people of the land went over to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They demolished the altars and smashed the idols to pieces, and they killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front of the altars. Jehoiada the priest stationed guards at the Temple of the Lord. | Then the commanders, the Carite mercenaries, the palace guards, and all the people of the land escorted the king from the Temple of the Lord.

      "ChapterText": "Cuando Atalía, la madre de Ocozías, vio que su hijo había muerto, empezó a matar a toda la familia real. Pero Josaba, hija del rey Joram y hermana de Ocozías, tomó a Joás, el hijo de Ocozías, y lo sacó a escondidas, junto con su nodriza, del dormitorio donde estaban a punto de matar a los príncipes. Lo escondió de Atalía, y así Joás no murió.\n\nDurante seis años estuvo escondido en el templo del SEÑOR, mientras Atalía gobernaba el país. Pero en el séptimo año, Joiada mandó llamar a los capitanes de los carios y de la guardia. Los hizo venir al templo del SEÑOR, les hizo jurar lealtad y luego les mostró al hijo del rey.\n\nLes dio estas instrucciones: “Esto es lo que deben hacer: un tercio de ustedes, los que entren de guardia el sábado, vigilarán el palacio del rey; otro tercio estará en la puerta Sur, y el último tercio en la puerta detrás de la guardia. Las dos compañías que salgan de turno esa semana deberán custodiar el templo del SEÑOR para proteger al rey. Rodeen al rey, cada uno con su arma en la mano, y si alguien intenta acercarse al grupo, mátenlo; permanezcan junto al rey, pase lo que pase.”\n\nLos capitanes hicieron exactamente lo que el sacerdote Joiada les ordenó. Cada uno con sus hombres, tanto los que entraban de guardia el sábado como los que salían, se presentaron ante el sacerdote Joiada. Él les entregó las lanzas y los escudos del rey David, que estaban en el templo del SEÑOR. Y los guardias, con las armas en la mano, se colocaron desde el extremo sur hasta el extremo norte del recinto, rodeando el altar y el templo para proteger al rey.\n\nEntonces Joiada sacó al hijo del rey, le puso la corona y las insignias reales. Lo proclamaron rey y lo ungieron, aplaudiendo y gritando: “¡Viva el rey!”\n\nAtalía oyó el alboroto del pueblo y fue al templo del SEÑOR donde estaba la multitud. Cuando vio al rey de pie junto a la columna, como era costumbre, y a los capitanes y trompeteros junto a él, y a todo el pueblo celebrando y tocando trompetas, rasgó sus vestiduras y gritó: “¡Traición, traición!”\n\nEntonces el sacerdote Joiada ordenó a los capitanes que estaban al mando del ejército: “Sáquenla fuera, entre las filas. Y si alguien la sigue, mátenlo a filo de espada.” Había dado la orden de que no la mataran en el templo del SEÑOR. Así que la sacaron a la fuerza hasta la puerta de los caballos del palacio real, y allí la mataron.\n\nDespués Joiada hizo un pacto entre el SEÑOR, el rey y el pueblo, para que fueran el pueblo del SEÑOR; y también hizo un pacto entre el rey y el pueblo. Entonces toda la gente fue al templo de Baal y lo destruyó. Rompieron completamente sus altares e imágenes, y mataron a Matán, el sacerdote de Baal, delante de los altares. Luego Joiada puso guardias para el templo del SEÑOR.\n\nCon los capitanes, los carios, la guardia y todo el pueblo, Joiada llevó al rey desde el templo del SEÑOR, pasando por la puerta de la guardia, hasta el palacio, donde Joás se sentó en el trono real. Todo el pueblo se alegró y la ciudad quedó tranquila, porque Atalía había sido muerta a filo de espada en el palacio real.",

Blessed be your glorious name, and may it be exalted above all blessing and praise. | You alone are the LORD. You made the heavens, even the highest heavens, and all their starry host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them.

You have kept your promise because you are righteous. | \"You saw the suffering of our forefathers in Egypt; you heard their cry at the Red Sea. | You sent miraculous signs and wonders against Pharaoh, against all his officials and all the people of his land, for you knew how arrogantly the Egyptians treated them. You made a name for yourself, which remains to this day. | You divided the sea before them, so that they passed through it on dry ground, but you hurled their pursuers into the depths, like a stone into mighty waters. | By day you led them with a pillar of cloud, and by night with a pillar of fire to give them light on the way they were to take. | \"You came down on Mount Sinai; you spoke to them from heaven. You gave them regulations and laws that are just and right, and decrees and commands that are good. | You made known to them your holy Sabbath and gave them commands, decrees and laws through your servant Moses. | In their hunger you gave them bread from heaven and in their thirst you brought them water from the rock; you told them to go in and take possession of the land you had sworn with uplifted hand to give them. | \"But they, our forefathers, became arrogant and stiff-necked, and did not obey your commands. | They refused to listen and failed to remember the miracles you performed among them. They became stiff-necked and in their rebellion appointed a leader in order to return to their slavery. But you are a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love. Therefore you did not desert them, | even when they cast for themselves an image of a calf and said, 'This is your god, who brought you up out of Egypt,' or when they committed awful blasphemies. | \"Because of your great compassion you did not abandon them in the desert. By day the pillar of cloud did not cease to guide them on their path, nor the pillar of fire by night to shine on the way they were to take. | You gave your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold your manna from their mouths, and you gave them water for their thirst. | For forty years you sustained them in the desert; they lacked nothing, their clothes did not wear out nor did their feet become swollen. | \"You gave them kingdoms and nations, allotting to them even the remotest frontiers. They took over the country of Sihon king of Heshbon and the country of Og king of Bashan. | You made their sons as numerous as the stars in the sky, and you brought them into the land that you told their fathers to enter and possess. | Their sons went in and took possession of the land. You subdued before them the Canaanites, who lived in the land; you handed the Canaanites over to them, along with their kings and the peoples of the land, to deal with them as they pleased. | They captured fortified cities and fertile land; they took possession of houses filled with all kinds of good things, wells already dug, vineyards, olive groves and fruit trees in abundance. They ate to the full and were well-nourished; they reveled in your great goodness. | \"But they were disobedient and rebelled against you; they put your law behind their backs. They killed your prophets, who had admonished them in order to turn them back to you; they committed awful blasphemies. | So you handed them over to their enemies, who oppressed them. But when they were oppressed they cried out to you. From heaven you heard them, and in your great compassion you gave them deliverers, who rescued them from the hand of their enemies. | \"But as soon as they were at rest, they again did what was evil in your sight. Then you abandoned them to the hand of their enemies so that they ruled over them. And when they cried out to you again, you heard from heaven, and in your compassion you delivered them time after time. | \"You warned them to return to your law, but they became arrogant and disobeyed your commands. They sinned against your ordinances, by which a man will live if he obeys them. Stubbornly they turned their backs on you, became stiff-necked and refused to listen. | For many years you were patient with them. By your Spirit you admonished them through your prophets. Yet they paid no attention, so you handed them over to the neighboring peoples. | But in your great mercy you did not put an end to them or abandon them, for you are a gracious and merciful God. | \"Now therefore, O our God, the great, mighty and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love, do not let all this hardship seem trifling in your eyes-the hardship that has come upon us, upon our kings and leaders, upon our priests and prophets, upon our fathers and all your people, from the days of the kings of Assyria until today. | In all that has happened to us, you have been just; you have acted faithfully, while we did wrong. | Our kings, our leaders, our priests and our fathers did not follow your law; they did not pay attention to your commands or the warnings you gave them. | Even while they were in their kingdom, enjoying your great goodness to them in the spacious and fertile land you gave them, they did not serve you or turn from their evil ways. | \"But see, we are slaves today, slaves in the land you gave our forefathers so they could eat its fruit and the other good things it produces. | Because of our sins, its abundant harvest goes to the kings you have placed over us. They rule over our bodies and our cattle as they please. We are in great distress. | \"In view of all this, we are making a binding agreement, putting it in writing, and our leaders, our Levites and our priests are affixing their seals to it.\"",

Thus you delivered them over into the power of the peoples of the lands. | Yet in your great mercy you did not completely destroy them and you did not forsake them, for you are a kind and merciful God. | \"Now, therefore, O our God, great, mighty, and awesome God, you who in your mercy preserve the covenant, take into account all the disasters that have befallen us, our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, our fathers, and your entire people, from the time of the kings of Assyria until this day! | In all that has come upon us you have been just, for you kept faith while we have done evil. | Yes, our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers have not kept your law; they paid no attention to your commandments and the obligations of which you reminded them. | While they were yet in their kingdom, in the midst of the many good things that you had given them and in the wide and fertile land that you had spread out before them, they did not serve you nor did they turn away from their evil deeds. | But, see, we today are slaves; and as for the land which you gave our fathers that they might eat its fruits and good things-- see, we have become slaves upon it! | Its rich produce goes to the kings whom you set over us because of our sins, who rule over our bodies and our cattle as they please. We are in great distress!\"",

      "ChapterText": "El día veinticuatro de ese mismo mes, los israelitas se reunieron, ayunando, vestidos de tela áspera y con polvo sobre la cabeza. Los de ascendencia israelita se habían separado de todos los extranjeros. Se pusieron de pie en sus lugares y confesaron sus pecados y las maldades de sus padres. Permanecieron en su sitio y leyeron el Libro de la Ley del SEÑOR su Dios durante una cuarta parte del día, y pasaron otra cuarta parte confesando y adorando al SEÑOR su Dios.\n\nEn las gradas estaban los levitas: Jesúa, Baní, Cadmiel, Sebanías, Buní, Serebías, Baní y Quenaní, quienes clamaban con voz fuerte al SEÑOR su Dios. Y los levitas Jesúa, Cadmiel, Baní, Hasabneías, Serebías, Hodías, Sebanías y Petahías dijeron: “¡Pónganse de pie y alaben al SEÑOR su Dios, que vive por siempre! Bendito sea tu glorioso nombre, que está por encima de toda bendición y alabanza.\n\nSolo tú eres el SEÑOR. Tú hiciste los cielos, incluso los cielos más altos y todo su ejército de estrellas, la tierra y todo lo que hay en ella, los mares y todo lo que contienen. Tú das vida a todo, y los ejércitos del cielo te adoran.\n\nTú eres el SEÑOR Dios, que escogiste a Abram, lo sacaste de Ur de los caldeos y le diste el nombre de Abraham. Hallaste fiel su corazón delante de ti, e hiciste un pacto con él para dar a sus descendientes la tierra de los cananeos, hititas, amorreos, ferezeos, jebuseos y gergeseos. Has cumplido tu promesa porque eres justo.\n\nViste el sufrimiento de nuestros antepasados en Egipto; escuchaste su clamor junto al Mar Rojo. Enviaste señales y maravillas contra el faraón, contra todos sus funcionarios y contra toda la gente de su tierra, porque sabías con cuánta arrogancia los trataban los egipcios. Te hiciste un nombre que aún perdura.\n\nDividiste el mar delante de ellos, de modo que pasaron por tierra seca, pero arrojaste a sus perseguidores a las profundidades, como una piedra en aguas poderosas. De día los guiaste con una columna de nube, y de noche con una columna de fuego para alumbrarles el camino que debían seguir.\n\nBajaste al monte Sinaí y les hablaste desde el cielo. Les diste normas y leyes justas, decretos y mandamientos buenos. Les diste a conocer tu santo sábado y les diste mandamientos, decretos y leyes por medio de tu siervo Moisés.\n\nEn su hambre les diste pan del cielo y en su sed les sacaste agua de la roca; les ordenaste que entraran y tomaran posesión de la tierra que habías jurado darles con mano levantada.\n\nPero ellos, nuestros antepasados, se volvieron arrogantes y tercos, y no obedecieron tus mandamientos. Se negaron a escuchar y no recordaron las maravillas que hiciste entre ellos. Se volvieron tercos y, en su rebeldía, nombraron un líder para regresar a su esclavitud. Pero tú eres un Dios perdonador, clemente y compasivo, lento para la ira y grande en amor. Por eso no los abandonaste,\n\nni siquiera cuando se hicieron un becerro de metal fundido y dijeron: ‘Este es tu dios, que te sacó de Egipto’, o cuando cometieron terribles blasfemias.\n\nPor tu gran compasión no los abandonaste en el desierto. De día la columna de nube no dejó de guiarlos por el camino, ni la columna de fuego de noche para alumbrarles el camino que debían seguir.\n\nDiste tu buen Espíritu para instruirlos. No les negaste tu maná, y les diste agua para su sed. Durante cuarenta años los sustentaste en el desierto; no les faltó nada, su ropa no se desgastó ni se les hincharon los pies.\n\nLes diste reinos y naciones, y repartiste entre ellos hasta los territorios más lejanos. Tomaron posesión del país de Sijón, rey de Hesbón, y del país de Og, rey de Basán.\n\nMultiplicaste a sus hijos como las estrellas del cielo y los llevaste a la tierra que habías prometido a sus padres que entrarían a poseer. Sus hijos entraron y tomaron posesión de la tierra. Humillaste ante ellos a los cananeos que habitaban en la tierra; los entregaste en sus manos, junto con sus reyes y los pueblos de la tierra, para que hicieran con ellos lo que quisieran.\n\nCapturaron ciudades fortificadas y tierras fértiles; tomaron casas llenas de toda clase de bienes, pozos ya cavados, viñedos, olivares y árboles frutales en abundancia. Comieron hasta saciarse, se deleitaron en tu gran bondad.\n\nPero fueron desobedientes y se rebelaron contra ti; echaron tu ley a sus espaldas. Mataron a tus profetas, que los amonestaban para hacerlos volver a ti; cometieron terribles blasfemias.\n\nPor eso los entregaste en manos de sus enemigos, que los oprimieron. Pero cuando estaban oprimidos clamaron a ti, y desde el cielo los escuchaste. Por tu gran compasión les diste libertadores que los salvaron de manos de sus enemigos.\n\nPero en cuanto tenían descanso, volvían a hacer lo malo ante tus ojos. Entonces los abandonabas en manos de sus enemigos, que los dominaban. Pero cuando volvían a clamar a ti, desde el cielo los escuchabas y, por tu compasión, los librabas una y otra vez.\n\nLes advertiste que volvieran a tu ley, pero se volvieron arrogantes y desobedecieron tus mandamientos. Pecaron contra tus ordenanzas, por las cuales el hombre vivirá si las cumple. Obstinadamente te dieron la espalda, se volvieron tercos y no quisieron escuchar.\n\nPor muchos años tuviste paciencia con ellos. Por tu Espíritu los amonestaste por medio de tus profetas, pero no hicieron caso, así que los entregaste en manos de los pueblos vecinos.\n\nPero por tu gran misericordia no los exterminaste ni los abandonaste, porque eres un Dios clemente y misericordioso.\n\nAhora pues, Dios nuestro, Dios grande, poderoso y temible, que cumples tu pacto de amor, no consideres poca cosa toda esta desgracia que nos ha sobrevenido, a nuestros reyes y jefes, a nuestros sacerdotes y profetas, a nuestros padres y a todo tu pueblo, desde los días de los reyes de Asiria hasta hoy.\n\nEn todo lo que nos ha pasado, tú has sido justo; tú has actuado fielmente, mientras nosotros hemos hecho lo malo.\n\nNuestros reyes, nuestros jefes, nuestros sacerdotes y nuestros padres no cumplieron tu ley; no prestaron atención a tus mandamientos ni a las advertencias que les diste.\n\nIncluso cuando estaban en su propio reino, disfrutando de tu gran bondad en la tierra espaciosa y fértil que les diste, no te sirvieron ni se apartaron de sus malas obras.\n\nPero mira, hoy somos esclavos, esclavos en la tierra que diste a nuestros antepasados para que comieran de su fruto y de sus bienes.\n\nPor nuestros pecados, su abundante cosecha va a parar a los reyes que has puesto sobre nosotros. Ellos dominan sobre nuestros cuerpos y nuestro ganado como quieren. Estamos en gran angustia.\n\nPor todo esto, hacemos un pacto firme, lo ponemos por escrito, y nuestros jefes, nuestros levitas y nuestros sacerdotes lo sellan con su firma.",

Tú eres el SEÑOR, el Dios que escogió a Abram, lo sacaste de Ur de los caldeos y le diste el nombre de Abraham. Hallaste fiel su corazón delante de ti e hiciste con él un pacto para dar a sus descendientes la tierra del cananeo, del hitita, del amorreo, del ferezeo, del jebuseo y del gergeseo.

Hiciste señales y maravillas contra el faraón, contra todos sus siervos y contra la gente de su tierra, porque sabías que actuaron con arrogancia contra nuestros padres. Así te hiciste un nombre, como se ve hasta hoy. Dividiste el mar delante de ellos, de modo que pasaron por en medio del mar en seco, y arrojaste a sus perseguidores a las profundidades, como una piedra en aguas poderosas.\n\nCon una columna de nube los guiaste de día, y con una columna de fuego de noche para alumbrarles el camino por donde debían ir. Bajaste al monte Sinaí y les hablaste desde el cielo; les diste normas justas, leyes verdaderas, estatutos y mandamientos buenos. Les diste a conocer tu santo sábado y les diste mandamientos, estatutos y una ley por medio de Moisés, tu siervo. Les diste pan del cielo para su hambre y sacaste agua de la roca para su sed. Les dijiste que entraran a poseer la tierra que habías jurado darles.\n\nPero ellos y nuestros padres actuaron con soberbia, endurecieron su cerviz y no obedecieron tus mandamientos. No quisieron obedecer ni recordaron las maravillas que hiciste entre ellos, sino que endurecieron su cerviz y, en su rebeldía, nombraron un líder para volver a su esclavitud en Egipto. Pero tú eres un Dios dispuesto a perdonar, clemente y compasivo, lento para la ira y grande en amor, y no los abandonaste.\n\nAun cuando se hicieron un becerro de oro y dijeron: ‘Este es tu dios que te sacó de Egipto’, y cometieron grandes blasfemias, tú, por tu gran misericordia, no los abandonaste en el desierto. La columna de nube no se apartó de ellos de día para guiarlos por el camino, ni la columna de fuego de noche para alumbrarles el camino por donde debían ir. Diste tu buen Espíritu para instruirlos, no les quitaste tu maná de la boca y les diste agua para su sed.\n\nDurante cuarenta años los sustentaste en el desierto y no les faltó nada. Sus ropas no se gastaron y sus pies no se hincharon. Les diste reinos y pueblos, y los repartiste por distritos. Así tomaron posesión de la tierra de Sihón, rey de Hesbón, y de la tierra de Og, rey de Basán.

Tomaron ciudades fortificadas y una tierra fértil, casas llenas de toda clase de bienes, cisternas ya cavadas, viñedos, olivares y árboles frutales en abundancia. Comieron, se saciaron, engordaron y se deleitaron en tu gran bondad.\n\nSin embargo, desobedecieron y se rebelaron contra ti, echaron tu ley a sus espaldas y mataron a tus profetas, que les advertían para hacerlos volver a ti, y cometieron grandes blasfemias. Por eso los entregaste en manos de sus enemigos, que los oprimieron. Pero en su angustia clamaron a ti, y tú los escuchaste desde el cielo; y por tu gran misericordia les diste libertadores que los salvaron de manos de sus enemigos.\n\nPero cuando tenían descanso, volvían a hacer lo malo delante de ti, y los abandonabas en manos de sus enemigos, que los dominaban. Sin embargo, cuando se volvían y clamaban a ti, tú los escuchabas desde el cielo, y muchas veces los libraste por tu misericordia. Les advertiste para hacerlos volver a tu ley, pero ellos actuaron con soberbia y no obedecieron tus mandamientos, sino que pecaron contra tus normas, que dan vida a quien las cumple. Endurecieron su cerviz, se obstinaron y no quisieron obedecer.\n\nPor muchos años tuviste paciencia con ellos y les advertiste por tu Espíritu a través de tus profetas, pero no quisieron escuchar. Por eso los entregaste en manos de los pueblos de otras tierras. Sin embargo, por tu gran misericordia no los exterminaste ni los abandonaste, porque eres un Dios clemente y compasivo.\n\nAhora pues, Dios nuestro, grande, poderoso y temible, que cumples el pacto y eres fiel en tu amor, no consideres poca la aflicción que ha venido sobre nosotros, sobre nuestros reyes, príncipes, sacerdotes, profetas, padres y sobre todo tu pueblo, desde los días de los reyes de Asiria hasta hoy. Pero tú eres justo en todo lo que nos ha sucedido, porque tú has actuado fielmente y nosotros hemos hecho lo malo.\n\nNuestros reyes, príncipes, sacerdotes y padres no cumplieron tu ley ni prestaron atención a tus mandamientos ni a las advertencias que les diste. Incluso en su propio reino, disfrutando de tu gran bondad que les diste, y en la tierra espaciosa y fértil que pusiste delante de ellos, no te sirvieron ni se apartaron de sus malas obras.\n\nMira, hoy somos esclavos; en la tierra que diste a nuestros padres para que comieran de su fruto y de sus bienes, aquí somos esclavos. Sus abundantes cosechas van a los reyes que has puesto sobre nosotros por causa de nuestros pecados. Ellos dominan sobre nuestros cuerpos y sobre nuestro ganado como quieren, y estamos en gran angustia.\n\nPor todo esto, hacemos un pacto firme y lo ponemos por escrito; en el documento sellado están los nombres de nuestros príncipes, levitas y sacerdotes.",

También venció a Moab, y los midió con una cuerda, haciéndolos acostarse en el suelo. Dos partes de ellos fueron condenadas a muerte y una parte fue perdonada. Así, los moabitas se convirtieron en siervos de David y le pagaban tributo.\n\nDavid también derrotó a Hadad-ezer, hijo de Rehob, rey de Soba, cuando éste fue a recuperar su dominio junto al río Éufrates. David le capturó mil setecientos jinetes y veinte mil soldados de infantería. Además, inutilizó todos los caballos de los carros, excepto los necesarios para cien carros.\n\nCuando los sirios de Damasco vinieron a ayudar a Hadad-ezer, rey de Soba, David mató a veintidós mil sirios. Luego puso guarniciones en Aram de Damasco, y los sirios se convirtieron en siervos de David y le pagaban tributo. El SEÑOR le daba la victoria a David dondequiera que iba.\n\nDavid tomó los escudos de oro que llevaban los siervos de Hadad-ezer y los llevó a Jerusalén. También tomó gran cantidad de bronce de Betá y de Berotai, ciudades de Hadad-ezer.\n\nCuando Toí, rey de Hamat, supo que David había derrotado a todo el ejército de Hadad-ezer, envió a su hijo Joram a saludar al rey David y a felicitarlo por haber peleado contra Hadad-ezer y haberlo vencido, ya que Hadad-ezer solía estar en guerra con Toí. Joram llevó consigo objetos de plata, oro y bronce.\n\nEl rey David también dedicó estos objetos al SEÑOR, junto con la plata y el oro que había consagrado de todas las naciones que había sometido: de Edom, Moab, los amonitas, los filisteos, Amalec y del botín de Hadad-ezer, hijo de Rehob, rey de Soba.\n\nDavid se hizo famoso cuando regresó de derrotar a dieciocho mil edomitas en el Valle de la Sal. Puso guarniciones en Edom; en todo Edom puso guarniciones, y todos los edomitas se convirtieron en siervos de David. El SEÑOR le daba la victoria a David dondequiera que iba.\n\nAsí, David reinó sobre todo Israel y gobernó a su pueblo con justicia y rectitud. Joab, hijo de Sarvia, estaba al mando del ejército; Josafat, hijo de Ahilud, era el cronista; Sadoc, hijo de Ahitub, y Ahimelec, hijo de Abiatar, eran sacerdotes; Seraías era secretario; Benaías, hijo de Joiada, estaba al mando de los cereteos y peleteos, y los hijos de David eran sacerdotes.",

También derrotó a Moab y los midió con una cuerda, haciéndolos acostarse en el suelo. Señaló dos medidas de cuerda para ejecutar y una medida completa para perdonar. Así los moabitas se convirtieron en vasallos de David y le pagaban tributo.\n\nLuego David derrotó a Hadadézer, hijo de Rehob, rey de Sobá, cuando éste fue a restablecer su dominio junto al río Éufrates. David le capturó mil setecientos jinetes y veinte mil soldados de infantería. Y desjarretó todos los caballos de los carros, reservando solo los suficientes para cien carros.\n\nCuando los arameos de Damasco vinieron a ayudar a Hadadézer, rey de Sobá, David mató a veintidós mil de ellos. Después David puso guarniciones en Aram de Damasco, y los arameos se convirtieron en súbditos y tributarios de David. El SEÑOR le dio la victoria a David en todo lo que emprendía.\n\nDavid también se llevó los escudos de oro que usaban los siervos de Hadadézer y los llevó a Jerusalén. (Estos escudos, Sisac, rey de Egipto, se los llevó cuando vino a Jerusalén en tiempos de Roboam, hijo de Salomón). De Tebaj y Berotai, ciudades de Hadadézer, el rey David tomó una gran cantidad de bronce.\n\nCuando Toí, rey de Hamat, se enteró de que David había derrotado a todo el ejército de Hadadézer, envió a su hijo Hadoram al rey David para saludarlo y felicitarlo por su victoria sobre Hadadézer en la batalla, porque Toí había estado en muchas guerras contra Hadadézer. Hadoram también llevó consigo objetos de plata, oro y bronce.\n\nEstos también los consagró el rey David al SEÑOR, junto con la plata y el oro que había tomado de todas las naciones que había conquistado: de Edom y Moab, de los amonitas, de los filisteos, de los amalecitas y del botín de Hadadézer, hijo de Rehob, rey de Sobá.\n\nAl regresar, David se hizo famoso por haber matado a dieciocho mil edomitas en el Valle de la Sal; después puso guarniciones en Edom.

Don’t welcome them. | Anyone who welcomes them shares in their evil work. | I have a lot to write to you. But I don’t want to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope I can visit you. Then I can talk with you face to face. That will make our joy complete. | The children of your chosen sister send their greetings.",

Enganchen los caballos; monten, jinetes, y pónganse de pie con sus cascos; afilen las lanzas y pónganse las corazas.\n\n¿Por qué los veo aterrados, retrocediendo? Sus valientes han sido derrotados, huyen rápidamente y no miran atrás, porque el terror los rodea, dice el SEÑOR.\n\nNo dejen que el veloz escape, ni que el valiente se salve; tropezarán y caerán hacia el norte, junto al río Éufrates.\n\n¿Quién es este que sube como un río desbordado, cuyas aguas se agitan como los ríos? Egipto se levanta como un río, y sus aguas se agitan como los ríos. Dice: “Subiré, cubriré la tierra, destruiré la ciudad y a sus habitantes”.\n\n¡Adelante, caballos! ¡Avancen, carros! Que salgan los valientes: los etíopes y los libios que portan escudo, y los lidios que manejan y tensan el arco.\n\nPorque este es el día del Señor DIOS de los ejércitos, día de venganza, para vengarse de sus enemigos. La espada devorará, se saciará y se embriagará con su sangre, porque el Señor DIOS de los ejércitos tiene un sacrificio en la tierra del norte, junto al río Éufrates.\n\nSube a Galaad y toma bálsamo, virgen hija de Egipto; en vano multiplicas los remedios, no hay curación para ti.\n\nLas naciones han oído tu vergüenza, y tu clamor ha llenado la tierra; porque el valiente tropezó con el valiente, y ambos cayeron juntos.\n\nPalabra que habló el SEÑOR a Jeremías el profeta, sobre cómo Nabucodonosor, rey de Babilonia, vendría y golpearía la tierra de Egipto.\n\nAnuncien en Egipto, proclamen en Migdol, proclamen en Nof y en Tafnes; digan: “Mantente firme y prepárate, porque la espada devorará a tu alrededor”.\n\n¿Por qué han sido arrasados tus valientes? No resistieron, porque el SEÑOR los hizo retroceder.\n\nHizo que muchos cayeran, uno sobre otro; y decían: “Levantémonos, volvamos a nuestro pueblo, a la tierra donde nacimos, huyendo de la espada opresora”.\n\nAllí gritaron: “Faraón, rey de Egipto, no es más que ruido; ha dejado pasar su oportunidad”.\n\nVivo yo, dice el Rey, cuyo nombre es el SEÑOR de los ejércitos, que así como el Tabor entre los montes y el Carmelo junto al mar, así vendrá.\n\nTú, hija que habitas en Egipto, prepárate para ir al cautiverio, porque Nof quedará desolada y vacía, sin habitantes.\n\nEgipto es como una novilla hermosa, pero la destrucción viene, viene del norte.\n\nTambién sus mercenarios están en medio de ella como becerros engordados, pero también ellos han huido juntos, no resistieron, porque el día de su calamidad vino sobre ellos, el tiempo de su castigo.\n\nSu voz se irá como la de una serpiente, porque vendrán con un ejército y la atacarán con hachas, como leñadores.\n\nCortarán su bosque, dice el SEÑOR, aunque sea impenetrable, porque son más numerosos que las langostas, incontables.\n\nLa hija de Egipto será avergonzada, será entregada en manos del pueblo del norte.\n\nEl SEÑOR de los ejércitos, el Dios de Israel, dice: “Voy a castigar a Amón de No, a Faraón, a Egipto, a sus dioses y a sus reyes; a Faraón y a todos los que confían en él.\n\nLos entregaré en manos de los que buscan su vida, en manos de Nabucodonosor, rey de Babilonia, y de sus siervos. Pero después será habitada como en tiempos pasados, dice el SEÑOR.\n\nPero tú, siervo mío Jacob, no temas, ni te asustes, Israel, porque yo te salvaré de lejos, y a tu descendencia de la tierra de su cautiverio. Jacob volverá, estará tranquilo y seguro, y nadie lo atemorizará.\n\nNo temas, siervo mío Jacob, dice el SEÑOR, porque yo estoy contigo. Destruiré por completo a todas las naciones a donde te he dispersado, pero a ti no te destruiré del todo; te corregiré con justicia, pero no te dejaré sin castigo”.",

Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers? | Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation. | That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten. | Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth. | For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion. | He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white. | Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth. | The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD's ministers, mourn. | The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth. | Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished. | The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men. | Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God. | Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD your God, and cry unto the LORD, | Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD is at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come. | Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from the house of our God? | The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered. | How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate. | O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field. | The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.",

Escuchen esto, ancianos, y presten atención, todos los habitantes del país. ¿Ha pasado algo así en sus días, o en los días de sus padres? Cuéntenle esto a sus hijos, y que sus hijos se lo cuenten a sus hijos, y ellos a la siguiente generación. Lo que dejó la oruga se lo comió la langosta; lo que dejó la langosta se lo comió el saltón; y lo que dejó el saltón se lo comió la larva. Despierten, borrachos, y lloren; griten todos los que beben vino, porque el vino nuevo les ha sido quitado de la boca. Porque ha subido contra mi tierra una nación poderosa, innumerable, con dientes de león y colmillos de león grande. Ha destruido mi viña y ha pelado mi higuera; la ha dejado desnuda y la ha tirado, y sus ramas han quedado blancas. Lamenten como una joven vestida de luto por el esposo de su juventud. La ofrenda de grano y la ofrenda de vino han sido cortadas de la casa del SEÑOR; los sacerdotes, ministros del SEÑOR, están de luto. El campo está arruinado, la tierra se lamenta, porque el grano está destruido; el vino nuevo se ha secado, el aceite se ha agotado. Avergüéncense, labradores; griten, viñadores, por el trigo y la cebada, porque la cosecha del campo se ha perdido. La vid se ha secado, la higuera está marchita; también el granado, la palmera y el manzano, todos los árboles del campo están secos, porque la alegría se ha marchitado entre los hombres. Vístanse de luto y lamenten, sacerdotes; griten, ministros del altar; vengan, pasen la noche vestidos de saco, ministros de mi Dios, porque la ofrenda de grano y la ofrenda de vino han sido retenidas de la casa de su Dios. Proclamen un ayuno, convoquen una asamblea solemne, reúnan a los ancianos y a todos los habitantes del país en la casa del SEÑOR su Dios, y clamen al SEÑOR. ¡Ay de ese día! Porque el día del SEÑOR está cerca, y vendrá como destrucción del Todopoderoso. ¿No ha sido cortada la comida ante nuestros ojos, y la alegría y el gozo de la casa de nuestro Dios? La semilla se pudre bajo los terrones, los graneros están vacíos, los almacenes derrumbados, porque el grano se ha secado. ¡Cómo gimen los animales! Las manadas de ganado andan confundidas porque no tienen pasto; también los rebaños de ovejas están desolados. A ti clamo, SEÑOR, porque el fuego ha devorado los pastos del desierto, y la llama ha consumido todos los árboles del campo. Hasta los animales del campo claman a ti, porque los ríos se han secado y el fuego ha devorado los pastos del desierto.",

And his mother's name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. | And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done. | At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged. | And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and his servants did besiege it. | And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign. | And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said. | And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land. | And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon. | And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon. | And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah. | Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. | And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. | For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.",

Entonces el SEÑOR envió contra él bandas de caldeos, bandas de sirios, bandas de moabitas y bandas de amonitas; los envió contra Judá para destruirlo, tal como el SEÑOR lo había dicho por medio de sus siervos los profetas. Todo esto le sucedió a Judá por orden del SEÑOR, para apartarlos de su presencia, por los pecados de Manasés y todo lo que él había hecho; y también por la sangre inocente que derramó, pues llenó Jerusalén de sangre inocente, y el SEÑOR no quiso perdonarlo.\n\nEl resto de los hechos de Joacim y todo lo que hizo, ¿no está escrito en el libro de las crónicas de los reyes de Judá? Joacim murió y descansó con sus padres, y su hijo Joaquín reinó en su lugar. El rey de Egipto no volvió a salir más de su tierra, porque el rey de Babilonia le había quitado todo lo que le pertenecía, desde el río de Egipto hasta el río Éufrates.\n\nJoaquín tenía dieciocho años cuando comenzó a reinar, y reinó en Jerusalén tres meses. Su madre se llamaba Nehusta, hija de Elnatán de Jerusalén. Joaquín hizo lo malo ante los ojos del SEÑOR, tal como lo había hecho su padre.\n\nEn ese tiempo, los siervos de Nabucodonosor, rey de Babilonia, subieron contra Jerusalén y sitiaron la ciudad. Nabucodonosor mismo vino contra la ciudad mientras sus siervos la sitiaban. Entonces Joaquín, rey de Judá, salió al encuentro del rey de Babilonia, junto con su madre, sus siervos, sus príncipes y sus oficiales; y el rey de Babilonia lo tomó prisionero en el octavo año de su reinado.\n\nSe llevó de allí todos los tesoros de la casa del SEÑOR y los tesoros de la casa real, y rompió en pedazos todos los utensilios de oro que Salomón, rey de Israel, había hecho para el templo del SEÑOR, tal como el SEÑOR lo había dicho. Se llevó cautiva a toda Jerusalén, a todos los príncipes, a todos los hombres valientes, unos diez mil cautivos, y a todos los artesanos y herreros; no quedó nadie, excepto la gente más pobre del país.\n\nLlevó cautivo a Joaquín a Babilonia, junto con la madre del rey, las esposas del rey, sus oficiales y a los poderosos del país; todos ellos fueron llevados cautivos de Jerusalén a Babilonia. A todos los hombres valientes, siete mil, y a los artesanos y herreros, mil, todos aptos y fuertes para la guerra, el rey de Babilonia los llevó cautivos a Babilonia.\n\nEl rey de Babilonia puso como rey en lugar de Joaquín a Matanías, tío de éste, y le cambió el nombre por Sedequías. Sedequías tenía veintiún años cuando comenzó a reinar, y reinó once años en Jerusalén. Su madre se llamaba Hamutal, hija de Jeremías de Libna. Sedequías hizo lo malo ante los ojos del SEÑOR, tal como lo había hecho Joacim.\n\nPor causa del enojo del SEÑOR, esto sucedió en Jerusalén y en Judá, hasta que finalmente los echó de su presencia. Sedequías se rebeló contra el rey de Babilonia.",

Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD. | I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed. | How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart; | Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal. | The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? saith the LORD. | Is not my word like as a fire? saith the LORD; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces? | Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that steal my words every one from his neighbour. | Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use their tongues, and say, He saith. | Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the LORD. | And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of the LORD? thou shalt then say unto them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the LORD. | And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his house. | Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother, What hath the LORD answered? and, What hath the LORD spoken? | And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every man's word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God. | Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD answered thee? and, What hath the LORD spoken? | But since ye say, The burden of the LORD; therefore thus saith the LORD; Because ye say this word, The burden of the LORD, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of the LORD; | Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and cast you out of my presence: | And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.",

      "ChapterText": "¡Ay de los pastores que destruyen y dispersan las ovejas de mi rebaño! —dice el SEÑOR—. Por eso, así dice el SEÑOR, el Dios de Israel, contra los pastores que apacientan a mi pueblo: Ustedes han dispersado mi rebaño, los han echado y no los han cuidado. Pues miren, yo les pediré cuentas por la maldad de sus acciones —dice el SEÑOR—. Yo mismo reuniré el resto de mi rebaño de todos los países a donde los eché, y los haré volver a sus pastos; serán fecundos y se multiplicarán. Pondré sobre ellos pastores que los cuiden, y no tendrán más miedo ni terror, ni faltará ninguno —dice el SEÑOR—.\n\nVienen días —afirma el SEÑOR— en que levantaré a David un retoño justo; un rey que reinará con sabiduría, actuará con justicia y rectitud en la tierra. En sus días Judá será salvado e Israel vivirá seguro. Y este es el nombre con el que lo llamarán: “El SEÑOR, nuestra justicia”.\n\nPor eso, vienen días —dice el SEÑOR— en que ya no dirán: “Vive el SEÑOR, que sacó a los hijos de Israel de la tierra de Egipto”, sino: “Vive el SEÑOR, que sacó y trajo a la descendencia de la casa de Israel de la tierra del norte y de todos los países a donde los había echado”; y habitarán en su propia tierra.\n\nMi corazón está destrozado dentro de mí por causa de los profetas; todos mis huesos tiemblan. Estoy como un borracho, como un hombre vencido por el vino, por causa del SEÑOR y de sus santas palabras. Porque la tierra está llena de adúlteros; por causa de la maldición la tierra está de luto, los pastos del desierto están secos. Su camino es malo, y su poder no es recto. Porque tanto el profeta como el sacerdote son impíos; aun en mi casa he hallado su maldad —dice el SEÑOR—.\n\nPor eso, su camino será para ellos como senderos resbaladizos en la oscuridad; serán empujados y caerán en ellos, porque traeré sobre ellos calamidad, el año de su castigo —dice el SEÑOR—. He visto locura en los profetas de Samaria: profetizaban en nombre de Baal y hacían errar a mi pueblo Israel. También he visto algo horrible en los profetas de Jerusalén: cometen adulterio y andan en mentiras; fortalecen las manos de los malhechores, para que nadie se aparte de su maldad. Todos ellos son para mí como Sodoma, y sus habitantes como Gomorra.\n\nPor eso, así dice el SEÑOR de los ejércitos acerca de los profetas: Miren, les daré de comer ajenjo y les haré beber agua envenenada, porque de los profetas de Jerusalén ha salido la impiedad por toda la tierra. Así dice el SEÑOR de los ejércitos: No escuchen las palabras de los profetas que les profetizan; ellos los llenan de falsas esperanzas. Hablan visiones de su propio corazón, no de la boca del SEÑOR. Dicen continuamente a los que me desprecian: “El SEÑOR ha dicho: Tendrán paz”; y a todos los que siguen la terquedad de su corazón les dicen: “No les vendrá ningún mal”.\n\n¿Quién ha estado en el consejo del SEÑOR, ha visto y oído su palabra? ¿Quién ha prestado atención a su palabra y la ha escuchado? Miren, la tempestad del SEÑOR, su furia, ha salido; una tempestad violenta caerá sobre la cabeza de los malvados. La ira del SEÑOR no se apartará hasta que haya hecho y cumplido los propósitos de su corazón. En los días venideros lo entenderán claramente.\n\nYo no envié a esos profetas, pero ellos corrieron; no les hablé, pero ellos profetizaron. Pero si hubieran estado en mi consejo, habrían hecho oír mis palabras a mi pueblo y los habrían hecho volver de su mal camino y de la maldad de sus acciones.\n\n¿Soy yo un Dios solo de cerca —dice el SEÑOR— y no también de lejos? ¿Podrá alguien esconderse en escondites donde yo no lo vea? —dice el SEÑOR—. ¿No lleno yo el cielo y la tierra? —dice el SEÑOR—.\n\nHe oído lo que dicen los profetas que profetizan mentiras en mi nombre, diciendo: “He soñado, he soñado”. ¿Hasta cuándo estará esto en el corazón de los profetas que profetizan mentiras, que son profetas del engaño de su propio corazón? Piensan hacer que mi pueblo olvide mi nombre con los sueños que se cuentan unos a otros, así como sus padres olvidaron mi nombre por Baal.\n\nEl profeta que tenga un sueño, que cuente el sueño; y el que tenga mi palabra, que hable mi palabra fielmente. ¿Qué tiene que ver la paja con el trigo? —dice el SEÑOR—. ¿No es mi palabra como fuego —dice el SEÑOR— y como un martillo que rompe la roca?\n\nPor eso, miren, yo estoy contra los profetas —dice el SEÑOR— que se roban mis palabras unos a otros. Miren, yo estoy contra los profetas —dice el SEÑOR— que usan su lengua y dicen: “Él dice”. Miren, yo estoy contra los que profetizan sueños falsos —dice el SEÑOR—, que los cuentan y hacen errar a mi pueblo con sus mentiras y su ligereza. Yo no los envié ni les di órdenes, y de nada aprovechan a este pueblo —dice el SEÑOR—.\n\nY cuando este pueblo, o el profeta, o un sacerdote te pregunte: “¿Cuál es la carga del SEÑOR?”, les responderás: “¿Qué carga? Los abandonaré —dice el SEÑOR—”. Y al profeta, al sacerdote o al pueblo que diga: “La carga del SEÑOR”, castigaré a ese hombre y a su casa.\n\nAsí dirán cada uno a su prójimo y cada uno a su hermano: “¿Qué ha respondido el SEÑOR? ¿Qué ha dicho el SEÑOR?” Y nunca más mencionarán “la carga del SEÑOR”, porque la palabra de cada uno será su propia carga, ya que han pervertido las palabras del Dios viviente, del SEÑOR de los ejércitos, nuestro Dios.\n\nAsí dirás al profeta: “¿Qué te ha respondido el SEÑOR? ¿Qué ha dicho el SEÑOR?” Pero si dicen: “La carga del SEÑOR”, entonces así dice el SEÑOR: “Porque dicen esta palabra, ‘la carga del SEÑOR’, habiendo yo enviado a decir: ‘No digan la carga del SEÑOR’”, por eso, yo los olvidaré por completo, los abandonaré a ustedes y a la ciudad que les di a ustedes y a sus padres, y los arrojaré lejos de mi presencia. Y traeré sobre ustedes oprobio eterno y vergüenza perpetua, que nunca será olvidada.",

He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth. | And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon. | And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. | For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night. | And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed. | And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity, | When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings: | How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth? | And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.",

      "ChapterText": "Cuando el hijo de Saúl se enteró de que Abner había muerto en Hebrón, se desanimó y todos los israelitas se alarmaron. El hijo de Saúl tenía dos hombres que eran capitanes de bandas: uno se llamaba Baaná y el otro Recab, hijos de Rimón, de Beerot, de la tribu de Benjamín (porque Beerot también se consideraba parte de Benjamín). Los habitantes de Beerot huyeron a Gitaim y viven allí como forasteros hasta hoy.\n\nJonatán, hijo de Saúl, tenía un hijo lisiado de los pies. Tenía cinco años cuando llegaron las noticias de la muerte de Saúl y Jonatán desde Jezreel. Su niñera lo tomó y huyó, pero en su prisa por escapar, el niño se cayó y quedó cojo. Su nombre era Mefiboset.\n\nLos hijos de Rimón, el beerotita, Recab y Baaná, fueron a la casa de Is-boset al mediodía, cuando él estaba acostado descansando. Entraron en la casa como si fueran a buscar trigo y lo apuñalaron en el vientre. Luego Recab y su hermano Baaná escaparon. Cuando entraron en la casa, Is-boset estaba acostado en su cama en su habitación; lo mataron, le cortaron la cabeza y se la llevaron, caminando toda la noche por el valle.\n\nLlevaron la cabeza de Is-boset a David en Hebrón y le dijeron al rey: “Aquí está la cabeza de Is-boset, hijo de Saúl, tu enemigo, que buscaba matarte. Hoy el SEÑOR ha vengado a mi señor el rey de Saúl y de su descendencia”.\n\nPero David respondió a Recab y a su hermano Baaná, hijos de Rimón el beerotita: “Vive el SEÑOR, que ha rescatado mi vida de toda angustia, que cuando uno vino a decirme: ‘Saúl ha muerto’, pensando que me traía buenas noticias, lo agarré y lo maté en Siclag, cuando él esperaba que yo le diera una recompensa por su noticia. ¿Cuánto más ahora que hombres malvados han matado a un hombre justo en su propia casa y en su cama? ¿No debería yo ahora pedir cuentas de su sangre y eliminarlos de la tierra?”\n\nEntonces David ordenó a sus hombres que los mataran. Les cortaron las manos y los pies y los colgaron junto al estanque de Hebrón. Pero tomaron la cabeza de Is-boset y la enterraron en la tumba de Abner en Hebrón.",

His mother's name also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. | And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah did. | And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper. | And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines. | And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims. | And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself exceedingly. | Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them. | Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry. | Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains. | The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valor were two thousand and six hundred. | And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy. | And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones. | And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvelously helped, till he was strong. | But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense. | And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men: | And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honor from the LORD God. | Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar. | And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him. | And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land. | Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write. | So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.",

      "ChapterText": "Entonces todo el pueblo de Judá tomó a Uzías, que tenía dieciséis años, y lo hicieron rey en lugar de su padre Amasías. Uzías reconstruyó Elot y la devolvió a Judá después de que el rey murió. Uzías tenía dieciséis años cuando comenzó a reinar, y reinó cincuenta y dos años en Jerusalén. Su madre se llamaba Jecolía, de Jerusalén. Uzías hizo lo que era correcto ante los ojos del SEÑOR, tal como lo había hecho su padre Amasías. Durante los días de Zacarías, que entendía las visiones de Dios, Uzías buscó a Dios; y mientras buscó al SEÑOR, Dios lo hizo prosperar.\n\nUzías salió a luchar contra los filisteos, derribó el muro de Gat, el muro de Jabne y el muro de Asdod, y construyó ciudades alrededor de Asdod y entre los filisteos. Dios lo ayudó contra los filisteos, contra los árabes que vivían en Gurbaal y contra los meunitas. Los amonitas le pagaban tributo a Uzías, y su fama llegó hasta la entrada de Egipto, porque se hizo muy poderoso.\n\nAdemás, Uzías construyó torres en Jerusalén, en la puerta de la esquina, en la puerta del valle y en el ángulo del muro, y las fortificó. También construyó torres en el desierto y cavó muchos pozos, porque tenía mucho ganado tanto en la llanura como en los valles. También tenía agricultores y viñadores en los montes y en el Carmelo, porque le gustaba la agricultura.\n\nUzías tenía un ejército de hombres valientes que salían a la guerra en divisiones, según el censo hecho por Jeiel, el escriba, y Maaseías, el oficial, bajo la dirección de Hananías, uno de los capitanes del rey. El número total de los jefes de familia de los valientes era de dos mil seiscientos. Bajo su mando había un ejército de trescientos siete mil quinientos hombres preparados para la guerra, con gran poder, para ayudar al rey contra el enemigo.\n\nUzías preparó para todo el ejército escudos, lanzas, cascos, corazas, arcos y hondas para tirar piedras. En Jerusalén hizo máquinas inventadas por ingenieros, que colocó en las torres y en las esquinas de las murallas para lanzar flechas y grandes piedras. Su fama se extendió mucho, porque fue ayudado maravillosamente hasta que se hizo fuerte.\n\nPero cuando se hizo fuerte, su corazón se llenó de orgullo y eso lo llevó a su ruina. Pecó contra el SEÑOR su Dios, entrando en el templo del SEÑOR para quemar incienso en el altar del incienso. El sacerdote Azarías entró tras él, junto con ochenta sacerdotes del SEÑOR, hombres valientes. Se enfrentaron al rey Uzías y le dijeron: “No te corresponde a ti, Uzías, quemar incienso al SEÑOR, sino a los sacerdotes, hijos de Aarón, que han sido consagrados para hacerlo. Sal del santuario, porque has pecado, y eso no te traerá honra delante del SEÑOR Dios”.\n\nUzías, que tenía un incensario en la mano para quemar incienso, se enojó. Mientras discutía con los sacerdotes, la lepra le brotó en la frente delante de los sacerdotes, en la casa del SEÑOR, junto al altar del incienso. Cuando el sumo sacerdote Azarías y todos los sacerdotes lo miraron, vieron que tenía lepra en la frente, y lo sacaron rápidamente de allí; y él mismo se apresuró a salir, porque el SEÑOR lo había herido.\n\nEl rey Uzías fue leproso hasta el día de su muerte, y vivió en una casa apartada, porque estaba excluido de la casa del SEÑOR. Su hijo Jotam se encargó del palacio real y gobernaba al pueblo de la tierra. El resto de los hechos de Uzías, desde el principio hasta el fin, los escribió el profeta Isaías, hijo de Amoz.\n\nUzías murió y fue sepultado con sus padres en el campo de enterramiento de los reyes, porque dijeron: “Es leproso”. Y su hijo Jotam reinó en su lugar.",

And Athaliah did reign over the land. | And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and showed them the king's son. | And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house; | And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down. | And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king. | And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in. | And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest. | And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the LORD. | And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple, along by the altar and the temple. | And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king. | And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD. | And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason. | But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without the ranges: and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD. | And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she slain. | And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people, that they should be the LORD's people; between the king also and the people. | And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD. | And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house.

Pero Josaba, hija del rey Joram y hermana de Ocozías, tomó a Joás, hijo de Ocozías, y lo sacó a escondidas de entre los hijos del rey que iban a matar; y ella y su nodriza lo escondieron en una habitación para que Atalía no lo matara. Así estuvo escondido con ella en el templo del SEÑOR durante seis años, mientras Atalía reinaba sobre el país.\n\nEn el séptimo año, Joiada mandó llamar a los jefes de cien, a los capitanes y a la guardia, y los llevó consigo al templo del SEÑOR. Allí hizo un pacto con ellos, les hizo jurar en el templo y les mostró al hijo del rey. Luego les dio instrucciones: “Esto es lo que deben hacer: una tercera parte de ustedes, que entra de guardia el sábado, vigilará el palacio real; otra tercera parte estará en la puerta de Sur, y la otra tercera parte en la puerta detrás de la guardia. Así protegerán el palacio para que nadie entre. Los otros dos grupos que salen de guardia el sábado protegerán el templo del SEÑOR junto al rey. Rodeen al rey por todos lados, cada uno con sus armas en la mano; y si alguien intenta acercarse, mátenlo. Estén siempre con el rey, cuando salga y cuando entre”.\n\nLos jefes de cien hicieron todo lo que el sacerdote Joiada les ordenó. Cada uno tomó a sus hombres, tanto los que entraban de guardia el sábado como los que salían, y fueron ante el sacerdote Joiada. Él les entregó las lanzas y los escudos del rey David que estaban en el templo del SEÑOR. Los guardias se colocaron, cada uno con su arma en la mano, desde el lado derecho hasta el lado izquierdo del templo, junto al altar y el templo, rodeando al rey.\n\nEntonces Joiada sacó al hijo del rey, le puso la corona y el testimonio, y lo proclamaron rey. Lo ungieron, aplaudieron y gritaron: “¡Viva el rey!”\n\nCuando Atalía oyó el alboroto de los guardias y del pueblo, fue al templo del SEÑOR donde estaba la gente. Al mirar, vio al rey de pie junto a la columna, como era costumbre, y a los jefes y trompetistas junto al rey, y a todo el pueblo celebrando y tocando trompetas. Atalía rasgó sus vestidos y gritó: “¡Traición, traición!”\n\nPero el sacerdote Joiada ordenó a los jefes de cien, encargados del ejército: “Sáquenla fuera del recinto y maten a espada a cualquiera que la siga”. Porque el sacerdote había dicho: “No la maten en el templo del SEÑOR”. Así que la apresaron y la llevaron por el camino por donde entran los caballos al palacio del rey, y allí la mataron.\n\nJoiada hizo un pacto entre el SEÑOR, el rey y el pueblo, para que fueran el pueblo del SEÑOR; también hizo un pacto entre el rey y el pueblo. Todo el pueblo fue al templo de Baal y lo derribó; destruyeron completamente sus altares e imágenes, y mataron a Matán, sacerdote de Baal, frente a los altares. Luego el sacerdote puso guardias en el templo del SEÑOR.\n\nDespués Joiada, junto con los jefes de cien, los capitanes, la guardia y todo el pueblo, bajaron al rey desde el templo del SEÑOR y entraron al palacio por la puerta de la guardia. El rey se sentó en el trono real. Todo el pueblo se alegró y la ciudad quedó tranquila, después de que mataron a Atalía a espada junto al palacio.\n\nJoás tenía siete años cuando comenzó a reinar.",

      "ChapterText": "Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them. | And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers. | And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the LORD their God. | Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto the LORD their God. | Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise. | Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee. | Thou art the LORD the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham; | And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous: | And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red sea; | And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as it is this day. | And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters. | Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go. | Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments: | And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant: | And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them. | But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments, | And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not. | Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations; | Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go. | Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst. | Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not. | Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan. | Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it. | So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would. | And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness. | Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations. | Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies. | But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the land of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies; | And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear. | Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands. | Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God. | Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day. | Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly: | Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them. | For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works. | Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it: | And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress. | And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, Levites, and priests, seal unto it.",

      "ChapterText": "El día veinticuatro de este mes, los hijos de Israel se reunieron para ayunar, vestidos de tela áspera y con tierra sobre la cabeza. Los descendientes de Israel se separaron de todos los extranjeros, se pusieron de pie y confesaron sus pecados y las maldades de sus padres. De pie en su lugar, leyeron el libro de la ley del Señor su Dios durante una cuarta parte del día; y durante otra cuarta parte confesaron sus pecados y adoraron al Señor su Dios.\n\nLuego, sobre la plataforma de los levitas, se pusieron de pie Jesúa, Baní, Cadmiel, Sebanías, Buní, Serebías, Baní y Quenaní, y clamaron en voz alta al Señor su Dios. Entonces los levitas Jesúa, Cadmiel, Baní, Hasabnías, Serebías, Hodías, Sebanías y Petahías dijeron: “Pónganse de pie y bendigan al Señor su Dios por siempre y para siempre. Bendito sea tu glorioso nombre, que está por encima de toda bendición y alabanza.\n\nTú solo eres el Señor; tú hiciste los cielos, los cielos de los cielos y todo su ejército, la tierra y todo lo que hay en ella, los mares y todo lo que contienen. Tú cuidas de todo eso, y el ejército del cielo te adora. Tú eres el Señor Dios, que escogiste a Abram, lo sacaste de Ur de los caldeos y le diste el nombre de Abraham. Hallaste fiel su corazón delante de ti, e hiciste un pacto con él para darle la tierra de los cananeos, hititas, amorreos, ferezeos, jebuseos y gergeseos, para dársela a su descendencia. Cumpliste tu palabra, porque eres justo.\n\nViste la aflicción de nuestros padres en Egipto y escuchaste su clamor junto al Mar Rojo. Hiciste señales y maravillas contra el faraón, contra todos sus siervos y contra la gente de su tierra, porque sabías que actuaban con arrogancia contra ellos. Así te hiciste un nombre, como sucede hasta hoy. Dividiste el mar delante de ellos, y pasaron por en medio del mar en seco; pero a sus perseguidores los arrojaste a las profundidades, como una piedra en aguas poderosas.\n\nDurante el día los guiaste con una columna de nube, y durante la noche con una columna de fuego, para alumbrarles el camino por donde debían ir. Bajaste al monte Sinaí, les hablaste desde el cielo y les diste juicios rectos, leyes verdaderas, estatutos y mandamientos buenos. Les diste a conocer tu santo sábado y les diste mandamientos, estatutos y leyes por medio de Moisés, tu siervo. Les diste pan del cielo para su hambre y sacaste agua de la roca para su sed. Les prometiste que entrarían a poseer la tierra que habías jurado darles.\n\nPero ellos y nuestros padres actuaron con soberbia, endurecieron su cerviz y no obedecieron tus mandamientos. Se negaron a obedecer y no recordaron las maravillas que hiciste entre ellos. Endurecieron su cerviz y, en su rebeldía, nombraron un jefe para regresar a su esclavitud. Pero tú eres un Dios dispuesto a perdonar, clemente y compasivo, lento para la ira y grande en misericordia, y no los abandonaste.\n\nIncluso cuando se hicieron un becerro de metal fundido y dijeron: ‘Este es tu dios que te sacó de Egipto’, y cometieron grandes ofensas, tú, por tu gran misericordia, no los abandonaste en el desierto. La columna de nube no se apartó de ellos de día para guiarlos por el camino, ni la columna de fuego de noche para alumbrarles el camino por donde debían ir. Les diste tu buen espíritu para instruirlos, no les negaste tu maná y les diste agua para su sed.\n\nDurante cuarenta años los sustentaste en el desierto; no les faltó nada, su ropa no se gastó ni se les hincharon los pies. Les diste reinos y naciones, y los repartiste por distritos; así poseyeron la tierra de Sijón, rey de Hesbón, y la tierra de Og, rey de Basán. Multiplicaste a sus hijos como las estrellas del cielo y los llevaste a la tierra que habías prometido a sus padres que poseerían.\n\nEntraron los hijos y poseyeron la tierra; sometiste ante ellos a los habitantes de la tierra, los cananeos, y los entregaste en sus manos, junto con sus reyes y los pueblos de la tierra, para que hicieran con ellos lo que quisieran. Tomaron ciudades fortificadas y una tierra fértil, casas llenas de toda clase de bienes, pozos ya cavados, viñedos, olivares y árboles frutales en abundancia. Comieron, se saciaron, engordaron y se deleitaron en tu gran bondad.\n\nPero fueron desobedientes, se rebelaron contra ti, echaron tu ley a sus espaldas, mataron a tus profetas que les amonestaban para hacerlos volver a ti, y cometieron grandes ofensas. Por eso los entregaste en manos de sus enemigos, que los oprimieron. Pero en el tiempo de su angustia, cuando clamaron a ti, tú los escuchaste desde el cielo y, por tu gran misericordia, les diste libertadores que los salvaron de manos de sus enemigos.\n\nPero cuando tenían descanso, volvían a hacer lo malo delante de ti; por eso los dejaste en manos de sus enemigos, para que los dominaran. Sin embargo, cuando se volvían y clamaban a ti, tú los escuchabas desde el cielo y muchas veces los libraste por tu misericordia. Les advertiste para hacerlos volver a tu ley, pero ellos actuaron con soberbia y no obedecieron tus mandamientos, sino que pecaron contra tus juicios (que si el hombre los cumple, vivirá por ellos), te dieron la espalda, endurecieron su cerviz y no quisieron escuchar.\n\nSin embargo, por muchos años tuviste paciencia con ellos y les advertiste por tu espíritu a través de tus profetas, pero no quisieron escuchar. Por eso los entregaste en manos de los pueblos de otras tierras. Pero por tu gran misericordia no los destruiste ni los abandonaste, porque eres un Dios clemente y compasivo.\n\nAhora pues, Dios nuestro, grande, poderoso y temible, que cumples el pacto y la misericordia, no consideres poca toda la aflicción que ha venido sobre nosotros, sobre nuestros reyes, príncipes, sacerdotes, profetas, padres y sobre todo tu pueblo, desde los días de los reyes de Asiria hasta hoy. Pero tú eres justo en todo lo que nos ha sucedido, porque tú has obrado con fidelidad, pero nosotros hemos hecho lo malo.\n\nNi nuestros reyes, príncipes, sacerdotes ni nuestros padres han guardado tu ley ni han obedecido tus mandamientos y testimonios con los que les advertiste. No te sirvieron en su reino, ni en tu gran bondad que les diste, ni en la tierra espaciosa y fértil que pusiste delante de ellos, ni se apartaron de sus malas obras.\n\nMira, hoy somos siervos; y en la tierra que diste a nuestros padres para que comieran de su fruto y de su bien, aquí somos siervos. Sus abundantes cosechas son para los reyes que has puesto sobre nosotros por causa de nuestros pecados; ellos dominan sobre nuestros cuerpos y sobre nuestro ganado como quieren, y estamos en gran angustia.\n\nPor todo esto, hacemos un pacto firme y lo ponemos por escrito; y nuestros príncipes, levitas y sacerdotes lo sellan.",

they made a molded calf for themselves,\n And said, 'This is your god\n That brought you up out of Egypt,'\n And worked great provocations,|Yet in Your manifold mercies\n You did not forsake them in

shrugged their shoulders,\n Stiffened their necks,\n And would not hear.|Yet for many years You had patience with them,\n And testified against them by Your Spirit in Your prophets.\n Yet they would not listen;\n Therefore You gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.|Nevertheless in Your great mercy\n You did not utterly consume them nor forsake them;\n For You are God, gracious and merciful.|\"Now therefore, our God,\n The great, the mighty, and awesome God,\n Who keeps covenant and mercy:\n Do not let all the trouble seem small before You\n That has come upon us,\n Our kings and our princes,\n Our priests and our prophets,\n Our fathers and on all Your people,\n From the days of the kings of Assyria until this day.|However You are just in all that has befallen us;\n For

And you have done what you promised, for you are always true to your word.|\"You saw the misery of our ancestors in Egypt, and you heard their cries from beside the Red Sea.|You displayed miraculous signs and wonders against Pharaoh, his officials, and all his people, for you knew how arrogantly they were treating our ancestors. You have a glorious reputation that has never been forgotten.|You divided the sea for your people so they could walk through on dry land! And then you hurled their enemies into the depths of the sea. They sank like stones beneath the mighty waters.|You led our ancestors by a pillar of cloud during the day and a pillar of fire at night so that they could find their way.|\"You came down at Mount Sinai and spoke to them from heaven.

Yet whenever your people turned and cried to you again for help, you listened once more from heaven. In your wonderful mercy, you rescued them many times!|\"You warned them to return to your Law, but they became proud and obstinate and disobeyed your commands.

And we are suffering terribly.\nThe people agree to obey God's law|'So we are making a firm agreement. We're writing it down. Our leaders are putting their official marks on it. And so are our Levites and priests.'",

Y el nombre de su madre era Hamutal, hija de Jeremías de Libna. | E hizo lo malo ante los ojos del SEÑOR, conforme a todo lo que Joacim había hecho. | Porque por la ira del SEÑOR sucedió en Jerusalén y Judá, hasta que los echó de su presencia, que Sedequías se rebeló contra el rey de Babilonia.",

El Señor no perdonaría esto. | El resto de los eventos del reinado de Joacim y todos sus hechos están registrados en El Libro de la Historia de los Reyes de Judá. | Cuando Joacim murió, su hijo Joaquín se convirtió en el siguiente rey. | El rey de Egipto no se aventuró a salir de su país después de eso, porque el rey de Babilonia capturó toda el área que antes reclamaba Egipto, desde el Arroyo de Egipto hasta el río Éufrates. | Joaquín tenía dieciocho años cuando se convirtió en rey, y reinó en Jerusalén tres meses. Su madre era Nehusta, la hija de Elnatán de Jerusalén. | Joaquín hizo lo malo a los ojos del Señor, tal como lo había hecho su padre. | Durante el reinado de Joaquín, los oficiales del rey Nabucodonosor de Babilonia atacaron Jerusalén y la sitiaron. | Nabucodonosor mismo llegó a la ciudad durante el sitio. | Entonces el rey Joaquín, junto con la reina madre, sus consejeros, sus comandantes y sus oficiales se rindieron a los babilonios. En el octavo año del reinado de Nabucodonosor, tomó a Joaquín prisionero. | Como el Señor había dicho de antemano, Nabucodonosor se llevó todos los tesoros del Templo del Señor y del palacio real. Despojó todos los objetos de oro que el rey Salomón de Israel había colocado en el Templo. | El rey Nabucodonosor llevó cautiva a toda Jerusalén, incluidos todos los comandantes y los mejores soldados, artesanos y artesanos—10,000 en total. Solo quedaron los más pobres en la tierra. | Nabucodonosor llevó al rey Joaquín como cautivo a Babilonia, junto con la reina madre, sus esposas y oficiales, y toda la élite de Jerusalén. | También exilió a 7,000 de los mejores soldados y 1,000 artesanos y artesanos, todos ellos fuertes y aptos para la guerra. | Luego el rey de Babilonia instaló a Matanías, el tío de Joaquín, como el siguiente rey, y cambió el nombre de Matanías a Sedequías. | Sedequías tenía veintiún años cuando se convirtió en rey, y reinó en Jerusalén once años. Su madre era Hamutal, la hija de Jeremías de Libna. | Pero Sedequías hizo lo malo a los ojos del Señor, tal como lo había hecho Joacim. | Estas cosas sucedieron debido a la ira del Señor contra el pueblo de Jerusalén y Judá, hasta que finalmente los desterró de su presencia y los envió al exilio. Sedequías se rebeló contra el rey de Babilonia.",

¿quién ha marcado su palabra, y la ha oído? | He aquí, un torbellino del SEÑOR ha salido con furia, incluso un torbellino grave: caerá gravemente sobre la cabeza de los malvados. | La ira del SEÑOR no se volverá, hasta que haya ejecutado, y hasta que haya realizado los pensamientos de su corazón: en los días postreros lo consideraréis perfectamente. | No he enviado a estos profetas, sin embargo, corrieron: no les he hablado, sin embargo, profetizaron. | Pero si hubieran estado en mi consejo, y hubieran hecho que mi pueblo oyera mis palabras, entonces los habrían hecho volver de su mal camino, y de la maldad de sus obras. | ¿Soy yo un Dios cercano, dice el SEÑOR, y no un Dios de lejos?

No les he hablado, sin embargo, profetizaron. | Pero si hubieran estado en Mi consejo, y hubieran hecho oír Mis palabras a Mi pueblo, entonces los habrían hecho volver de su mal camino y de la maldad de sus obras. | ¿Soy yo un Dios cercano, dice el Señor, y no un Dios lejano? | ¿Puede alguien esconderse en lugares secretos, para que yo no lo vea? dice el Señor; ¿No lleno yo el cielo y la tierra? dice el Señor. | He oído lo que los profetas han dicho que profetizan mentiras en Mi nombre, diciendo, ¡He soñado, he soñado! | ¿Hasta cuándo estará esto en el corazón de los profetas que profetizan mentiras? En verdad son profetas del engaño de su propio corazón, | que tratan de hacer olvidar a Mi pueblo Mi nombre con sus sueños que cada uno cuenta a su vecino, como sus padres olvidaron Mi nombre por Baal. | El profeta que tiene un sueño, que cuente un sueño; y el que tiene Mi palabra, que hable Mi palabra fielmente. ¿Qué es la paja al trigo? dice el Señor. | ¿No es Mi palabra como un fuego? dice el Señor, y como un martillo que rompe la roca en pedazos? | Por tanto, he aquí, estoy contra los profetas, dice el Señor, que roban Mis palabras cada uno de su vecino. | He aquí, estoy contra los profetas, dice el Señor, que usan sus lenguas y dicen, Él dice. | He aquí, estoy contra aquellos que profetizan sueños falsos, dice el Señor, y los cuentan, y hacen errar a Mi pueblo con sus mentiras y con su imprudencia. Sin embargo, no los envié ni los mandé; por tanto, no beneficiarán en nada a este pueblo, dice el Señor. | Así que cuando este pueblo o el profeta o el sacerdote te pregunten, diciendo, ¿Cuál es el oráculo del Señor? entonces les dirás, ¿Qué oráculo? Incluso los abandonaré, dice el Señor. | Y en cuanto al profeta y al sacerdote y al pueblo que digan, ¡El oráculo del Señor! incluso castigaré a ese hombre y a su casa. | Así que cada uno de ustedes dirá a su vecino, y cada uno a su hermano, ¿Qué ha respondido el Señor? y, ¿Qué ha hablado el Señor? | Y el oráculo del Señor no lo mencionarán más. Porque la palabra de cada hombre será su oráculo, porque han pervertido las palabras del Dios viviente, el Señor de los ejércitos, nuestro Dios. | Así dirás al profeta, ¿Qué te ha respondido el Señor? y, ¿Qué ha hablado el Señor? | Pero ya que dicen, ¡El oráculo del Señor! por tanto, así dice el Señor: Porque dicen esta palabra, ¡El oráculo del Señor! y les he enviado, diciendo, No digan, ¡El oráculo del Señor! | por tanto, he aquí, yo, incluso yo, los olvidaré por completo y los abandonaré, y la ciudad que les di a ustedes y a sus padres, y los echaré de Mi presencia. | Y traeré sobre ustedes un reproche eterno, y una vergüenza perpetua, que no será olvidada.",

      "ChapterText": "Qué tristeza les espera a los líderes de mi pueblo—los pastores de mis ovejas—porque han destruido y dispersado a aquellos a quienes debían cuidar, dice el Señor. | Por lo tanto, esto es lo que el Señor, el Dios de Israel, dice a estos pastores: En lugar de cuidar de mi rebaño y guiarlos a la seguridad, los han abandonado y llevado a la destrucción. Ahora derramaré juicio sobre ustedes por el mal que les han hecho. | Pero reuniré al remanente de mi rebaño de los países a donde los he dispersado. Los traeré de vuelta a su propio redil, y serán fructíferos y aumentarán en número. | Entonces nombraré pastores responsables para que los cuiden, y nunca más tendrán miedo. No se perderá ni faltará uno solo. ¡Yo, el Señor, he hablado! | Porque viene el tiempo, dice el Señor, en que levantaré un descendiente justo de la línea del rey David. Será un Rey que gobernará con sabiduría. Hará lo que es justo y correcto en toda la tierra. | Y este será su nombre: El Señor es Nuestra Justicia. En ese día Judá será salvado, e Israel vivirá seguro. | En ese día, dice el Señor, cuando la gente haga un juramento, ya no dirán: Tan cierto como que el Señor vive, que rescató al pueblo de Israel de la tierra de Egipto. | En cambio, dirán: Tan cierto como que el Señor vive, que trajo al pueblo de Israel de regreso a su propia tierra desde la tierra del norte y de todos los países a los que los había exiliado. Entonces vivirán en su propia tierra. | Mi corazón está roto por los falsos profetas, y mis huesos tiemblan. Me tambaleo como un borracho, como alguien vencido por el vino, debido a las santas palabras que el Señor ha hablado contra ellos. | Porque la tierra está llena de adulterio, y yace bajo una maldición. La tierra misma está de luto—sus pastizales en el desierto están secos. Porque todos hacen el mal y abusan del poder que tienen. | Incluso los sacerdotes y profetas son hombres impíos y malvados. He visto sus actos despreciables aquí mismo en mi propio Templo, dice el Señor. | Por lo tanto, los caminos que toman se volverán resbaladizos. Serán perseguidos en la oscuridad, y allí caerán. Porque traeré desastre sobre ellos en el momento fijado para su castigo. ¡Yo, el Señor, he hablado! | Vi que los profetas de Samaria eran terriblemente malvados, porque profetizaban en el nombre de Baal y llevaban a mi pueblo de Israel al pecado. | ¡Pero ahora veo que los profetas de Jerusalén son aún peores! Cometen adulterio y aman la deshonestidad. Alientan a los que hacen el mal para que nadie se aparte de sus pecados. Estos profetas son tan malvados como lo fueron los habitantes de Sodoma y Gomorra. | Por lo tanto, esto es lo que dice el Señor de los Ejércitos Celestiales acerca de los profetas: Los alimentaré con amargura y les daré veneno para beber. Porque es por culpa de los profetas de Jerusalén que la maldad ha llenado esta tierra. | Esto es lo que dice el Señor de los Ejércitos Celestiales a su pueblo: No escuchen a estos profetas cuando les profeticen, llenándolos de esperanzas inútiles. Están inventando todo lo que dicen. ¡No hablan por el Señor! | Siguen diciendo a los que desprecian mi palabra: ¡No se preocupen! ¡El Señor dice que tendrán paz! Y a los que tercamente siguen sus propios deseos, les dicen: ¡No les vendrá ningún mal! | ¿Alguno de estos profetas ha estado en la presencia del Señor para escuchar lo que realmente está diciendo? ¿Alguno de ellos se ha preocupado lo suficiente como para escuchar? | ¡Miren! La ira del Señor estalla como una tormenta, un torbellino que se arremolina sobre las cabezas de los malvados. | La ira del Señor no disminuirá hasta que haya terminado todo lo que ha planeado. En los días venideros entenderán todo esto muy claramente. | No he enviado a estos profetas, sin embargo, andan diciendo que hablan por mí. No les he dado ningún mensaje, sin embargo, siguen profetizando. | Si se hubieran presentado ante mí y me hubieran escuchado, habrían hablado mis palabras, y habrían apartado a mi pueblo de sus malos caminos y acciones. | ¿Soy un Dios que está solo cerca? dice el Señor. No, estoy lejos al mismo tiempo. | ¿Puede alguien esconderse de mí en un lugar secreto? ¿No estoy en todas partes en todos los cielos y la tierra? dice el Señor. | He oído a estos profetas decir: Escuchen el sueño que tuve de Dios anoche. Y luego proceden a contar mentiras en mi nombre. | ¿Cuánto tiempo seguirá esto? Si son profetas, son profetas de engaño, inventando todo lo que dicen. | Al contar estos falsos sueños, están tratando de hacer que mi pueblo se olvide de mí, tal como lo hicieron sus antepasados al adorar a los ídolos de Baal. | Que estos falsos profetas cuenten sus sueños, pero que mis verdaderos mensajeros proclamen fielmente cada una de mis palabras. ¡Hay una diferencia entre la paja y el grano! | ¿No arde mi palabra como fuego? dice el Señor. ¿No es como un martillo poderoso que rompe una roca en pedazos? | Por lo tanto, dice el Señor, estoy en contra de estos profetas que se roban mensajes entre sí y afirman que son de mí. | Estoy en contra de estos profetas de lengua suave que dicen: ¡Esta profecía es del Señor! | Estoy en contra de estos falsos profetas. Sus sueños imaginarios son mentiras flagrantes que llevan a mi pueblo al pecado. No los envié ni los designé, y no tienen ningún mensaje para mi pueblo. ¡Yo, el Señor, he hablado! | Supongamos que una de las personas o uno de los profetas o sacerdotes te pregunta: ¿Qué profecía te ha cargado el Señor? Debes responder: ¡Ustedes son la carga! ¡El Señor dice que los abandonará! | Si algún profeta, sacerdote o cualquier otra persona dice: Tengo una profecía del Señor, castigaré a esa persona junto con toda su familia. | Deberían seguir preguntándose unos a otros: ¿Cuál es la respuesta del Señor? o ¿Qué está diciendo el Señor? | Pero dejen de usar esta frase, profecía del Señor. Porque la gente la está usando para dar autoridad a sus propias ideas, trastornando las palabras de nuestro Dios, el Dios viviente, el Señor de los Ejércitos Celestiales. | Esto es lo que deben decir a los profetas: ¿Cuál es la respuesta del Señor? o ¿Qué está diciendo el Señor? | Pero supongamos que responden: ¡Esta es una profecía del Señor! Entonces deben decir: Esto es lo que dice el Señor: Porque han usado esta frase, profecía del Señor, aunque les advertí que no la usaran, | los olvidaré por completo. Los expulsaré de mi presencia, junto con esta ciudad que les di a ustedes y a sus antepasados. | Y los convertiré en objeto de burla, y su nombre será infame a lo largo de los siglos.",

Estoy a punto de atenderlos a ustedes por sus malas acciones—esta es la declaración del Señor. | Reuniré al remanente de mi rebaño de todas las tierras donde los he desterrado, y los devolveré a su tierra de pastoreo. Serán fructíferos y numerosos. | Levantaré pastores sobre ellos que los cuidarán. Ya no tendrán miedo ni desánimo, ni faltará ninguno. Esta es la declaración del Señor. | Miren, vienen días—esta es la declaración del Señor—cuando levantaré un Retoño Justo para David. Él reinará sabiamente como rey y administrará justicia y rectitud en la tierra. | En sus días Judá será salvado, e Israel vivirá seguro. Este es el nombre que se le dará: El Señor es Nuestra Justicia. | Miren, vienen días—esta es la declaración del Señor—cuando ya no se dirá, Vive el Señor que sacó a los israelitas de la tierra de Egipto, | sino, Vive el Señor que sacó y guió a los descendientes de la casa de Israel desde la tierra del norte y de todos los otros países donde los había desterrado. Volverán a habitar en su propia tierra. | En cuanto a los profetas: Mi corazón está roto dentro de mí, y todos mis huesos tiemblan. Me he vuelto como un borracho, como un hombre vencido por el vino, por causa del Señor, por causa de sus santas palabras. | Porque la tierra está llena de adúlteros; la tierra llora por la maldición, y las tierras de pastoreo en el desierto se han secado. Su forma de vida se ha vuelto malvada, y su poder no se usa correctamente | porque tanto el profeta como el sacerdote son impíos, incluso en mi casa he encontrado su maldad. Esta es la declaración del Señor. | Por lo tanto, su camino será para ellos como senderos resbaladizos en la penumbra. Serán empujados y caerán allí, porque traeré desastre sobre ellos, el año de su castigo. Esta es la declaración del Señor. | Entre los profetas de Samaria vi algo repugnante: Profetizaban por Baal y desviaron a mi pueblo Israel. | Entre los profetas de Jerusalén también vi algo horrible: Cometen adulterio y caminan en mentiras. Fortalecen las manos de los malhechores, y ninguno se aparta del mal. Todos son para mí como Sodoma; los habitantes de Jerusalén son como Gomorra. | Por lo tanto, esto es lo que dice el Señor de los Ejércitos respecto a los profetas: Estoy a punto de darles ajenjo para comer y agua envenenada para beber, porque de los profetas de Jerusalén la impiedad se ha extendido por toda la tierra. | Esto es lo que dice el Señor de los Ejércitos: No escuchen las palabras de los profetas que les profetizan. Los están engañando; hablan visiones de su propia mente, no de la boca del Señor. | Siguen diciendo a los que me desprecian, El Señor ha hablado: Tendrán paz. Han dicho a todos los que siguen la terquedad de su corazón, No les vendrá ningún mal. | Porque ¿quién ha estado en el consejo del Señor para ver y oír su palabra? ¿Quién ha prestado atención a su palabra y obedecido? | ¡Miren, una tormenta del Señor! La ira ha salido, una tormenta arremolinada. Girará sobre las cabezas de los malvados. | La ira del Señor no se apartará hasta que haya cumplido completamente los propósitos de su corazón.

Porque ¿qué es la paja comparada con el grano?—esta es la declaración del Señor. | ¿No es mi palabra como fuego—esta es la declaración del Señor—y como un martillo que pulveriza la roca? | Por lo tanto, ¡tomen nota!

Los arrojaré—esta es la declaración del Señor. | En cuanto al profeta, sacerdote o pueblo que diga, La carga del Señor, castigaré a ese hombre y a su casa. | Esto es lo que cada hombre debe decir a su amigo y a su hermano: ¿Qué ha respondido el Señor? o ¿Qué ha hablado el Señor? | Pero ya no se refieran a la carga del Señor, porque la palabra de cada hombre se convierte en su carga y pervierten las palabras del Dios viviente, el Señor de los Ejércitos, nuestro Dios. | Deben decir al profeta: ¿Qué te ha respondido el Señor? y ¿Qué ha hablado el Señor? | Pero si dices, La carga del Señor, entonces esto es lo que dice el Señor: Porque has dicho, La carga del Señor, y específicamente te dije que no dijeras, La carga del Señor, | ciertamente te olvidaré y te arrojaré de mi presencia a ti y a la ciudad que te di a ti y a tus antepasados. | Traeré sobre ti una desgracia y humillación eternas que nunca serán olvidadas.",

Soy como un hombre fuerte que ha bebido demasiado vino. Eso es por el Señor y sus santas palabras. | La tierra está llena de personas que no son fieles al Señor. Por eso, la tierra está bajo una maldición. Los pastizales en el desierto están secos. Los profetas hacen lo malo. Su uso del poder no es correcto. | Los profetas y sacerdotes son impíos.

Ayudan a los que hacen el mal, para que nadie se aparte de sus pecados. Todos ellos son como la gente de Sodoma para mí. La gente de Jerusalén es como los que vivieron en Gomorra. | Así que el Señor que gobierna sobre todo habla sobre los profetas. Él dice: Les haré comer comida amarga. Les haré beber agua envenenada. Eso es porque la impiedad se ha extendido por toda la tierra. Los profetas de Jerusalén son responsables de ello. | El Señor que gobierna sobre todo dice al pueblo de Jerusalén: No escuchen lo que los profetas les están profetizando. Los llenan de falsas esperanzas. Hablan de visiones que provienen de sus propias mentes. Lo que dicen no viene de la boca del Señor. | Siguen diciendo a los que me odian: El Señor dice: Tendrán paz.

Dicen: ¡Tuve un sueño! ¡Tuve un sueño! | ¿Cuánto tiempo continuará eso en los corazones de estos profetas que profetizan mentiras? Son profetas de sus propios corazones equivocados. | Intentan hacer que mi pueblo olvide mi nombre. Lo hacen contándose unos a otros sueños que sus corazones han inventado. Es como si su pueblo de hace mucho tiempo olvidara mi nombre por causa de Baal. | Que el profeta que tiene un sueño cuente su sueño. Pero que el que tiene mi mensaje lo hable fielmente. La paja no es lo mismo que el grano, anuncia el Señor. | Mi mensaje es como fuego, anuncia el Señor.

Y así retuercen las palabras del Dios viviente. Él es el Señor que gobierna sobre todo. Él es nuestro Dios. | Esto es lo que siguen diciendo a un profeta. Preguntan: ‘¿Qué respuesta ha dado el Señor?’ o, ‘¿Qué ha hablado el Señor?’ | Pero supongamos que afirman: ‘Aquí hay un mensaje del Señor.’ Entonces el Señor dice: ‘Usan las palabras, “Aquí hay un mensaje del Señor.” Aunque les dije que no usaran esas palabras, | esto es lo que sucederá.

Esto lo quitó de en medio, clavándolo en la cruz. | Desarmó a los principados y a las autoridades y los exhibió públicamente, triunfando sobre ellos en él. | Por tanto, que nadie los juzgue en cuestiones de comida o bebida, o en cuanto a días de fiesta, luna nueva o sábados. | Estas cosas son sombra de lo que ha de venir, pero el cuerpo es de Cristo. | Que nadie los descalifique, insistiendo en ascetismo y culto a los ángeles, detallando visiones, envanecido sin razón por su mente carnal, | y no aferrándose a la Cabeza, de quien todo el cuerpo, nutrido y unido por sus coyunturas y ligamentos, crece con el crecimiento que da Dios. | Si con Cristo murieron a los principios elementales del mundo, ¿por qué, como si vivieran en el mundo, se someten a preceptos- | \"No manejes, No pruebes, No toques\" | (refiriéndose a cosas que todas perecen con el uso)- según mandamientos y doctrinas de hombres? | Estas cosas tienen, a la verdad, cierta reputación de sabiduría en culto voluntario, en humildad y en duro trato del cuerpo, pero no tienen valor alguno contra los apetitos de la carne.",

      "ChapterText": "El pueblo de Israel hizo lo malo ante los ojos del SEÑOR, y el SEÑOR los entregó en manos de Madián por siete años. | Y la mano de Madián prevaleció sobre Israel, y a causa de Madián los israelitas se hicieron escondites en las montañas, cuevas y fortalezas. | Cada vez que los israelitas sembraban, los madianitas, amalecitas y los pueblos del oriente subían contra ellos. | Acampaban contra ellos y destruían los productos de la tierra hasta Gaza, y no dejaban sustento en Israel, ni ovejas, ni bueyes, ni asnos. | Subían con su ganado y sus tiendas; venían en multitud como langostas, tanto ellos como sus camellos eran innumerables, y devastaban la tierra al llegar. | Israel se empobreció mucho a causa de Madián, y los israelitas clamaron al SEÑOR pidiendo ayuda. | Cuando los israelitas clamaron al SEÑOR a causa de los madianitas, | el SEÑOR envió un profeta a los israelitas. Y les dijo: \"Así dice el SEÑOR, el Dios de Israel: Yo los saqué de Egipto y los libré de la casa de servidumbre. | Los libré de la mano de los egipcios y de todos los que los oprimían, los expulsé delante de ustedes y les di su tierra. | Y les dije: 'Yo soy el SEÑOR su Dios; no teman a los dioses de los amorreos en cuya tierra habitan.' Pero no han obedecido mi voz.\" | Entonces el ángel del SEÑOR vino y se sentó bajo la encina en Ofra, que pertenecía a Joás el abiezerita, mientras su hijo Gedeón estaba trillando trigo en el lagar para esconderlo de los madianitas. | Y el ángel del SEÑOR se le apareció y le dijo: \"El SEÑOR está contigo, valiente guerrero.\" | Y Gedeón le respondió: \"Por favor, señor, si el SEÑOR está con nosotros, ¿por qué nos ha sobrevenido todo esto? ¿Dónde están todas sus maravillas que nuestros padres nos contaron, diciendo: '¿No nos sacó el SEÑOR de Egipto?' Pero ahora el SEÑOR nos ha abandonado y nos ha entregado en manos de Madián.\" | Y el SEÑOR se volvió hacia él y le dijo: \"Ve con esta tu fuerza y salva a Israel de la mano de Madián; ¿no te envío yo?\" | Y él le respondió: \"Por favor, Señor, ¿cómo podré salvar a Israel? Mi clan es el más débil de Manasés, y yo soy el menor en la casa de mi padre.\" | Y el SEÑOR le dijo: \"Pero yo estaré contigo, y derrotarás a los madianitas como a un solo hombre.\" | Y él le dijo: \"Si he hallado gracia ante tus ojos, dame una señal de que eres tú quien habla conmigo. | Por favor, no te vayas de aquí hasta que vuelva a ti y traiga mi ofrenda y la ponga delante de ti.\" Y él dijo: \"Me quedaré hasta que vuelvas.\" | Entonces Gedeón entró en su casa y preparó un cabrito y panes sin levadura de un efa de harina. Puso la carne en una canasta y el caldo en una olla, y los llevó bajo la encina y se los presentó. | Y el ángel de Dios le dijo: \"Toma la carne y los panes sin levadura, ponlos sobre esta roca y derrama el caldo sobre ellos.\" Y así lo hizo. | Entonces el ángel del SEÑOR extendió la punta del bastón que tenía en su mano y tocó la carne y los panes sin levadura. Y salió fuego de la roca y consumió la carne y los panes sin levadura. Y el ángel del SEÑOR desapareció de su vista. | Entonces Gedeón se dio cuenta de que era el ángel del SEÑOR. Y Gedeón dijo: \"¡Ay, Señor DIOS! Porque he visto al ángel del SEÑOR cara a cara.\" | Pero el SEÑOR le dijo: \"Paz a ti. No temas; no morirás.\" | Entonces Gedeón construyó allí un altar al SEÑOR y lo llamó, El SEÑOR es Paz. Hasta el día de hoy está en Ofra, que pertenece a los abiezeritas. | Esa noche el SEÑOR le dijo: \"Toma el toro de tu padre, y el segundo toro de siete años, y derriba el altar de Baal que tiene tu padre, y corta la Asera que está junto a él | y construye un altar al SEÑOR tu Dios en la cima de esta fortaleza, con piedras colocadas en orden debido. Luego toma el segundo toro y ofrécelo como holocausto con la madera de la Asera que cortarás.\" | Entonces Gedeón tomó a diez de sus siervos e hizo como el SEÑOR le había dicho. Pero como tenía demasiado miedo de su familia y de los hombres de la ciudad para hacerlo de día, lo hizo de noche. | Cuando los hombres de la ciudad se levantaron temprano en la mañana, he aquí, el altar de Baal estaba derribado, y la Asera junto a él estaba cortada, y el segundo toro había sido ofrecido en el altar que se había construido. | Y se dijeron unos a otros: \"¿Quién ha hecho esto?\" Y después de investigar y preguntar, dijeron: \"Gedeón, hijo de Joás, ha hecho esto.\" | Entonces los hombres de la ciudad dijeron a Joás: \"Saca a tu hijo, para que muera, porque ha derribado el altar de Baal y ha cortado la Asera que estaba junto a él.\" | Pero Joás dijo a todos los que estaban contra él: \"¿Contenderán ustedes por Baal? ¿O lo salvarán? Cualquiera que contienda por él será muerto antes de la mañana. Si es un dios, que contienda por sí mismo, porque su altar ha sido derribado.\" | Por lo tanto, en ese día Gedeón fue llamado Jerobaal, es decir, \"Que Baal contienda contra él,\" porque derribó su altar. | Ahora todos los madianitas, amalecitas y los pueblos del oriente se reunieron, cruzaron el Jordán y acamparon en el Valle de Jezreel. | Pero el Espíritu del SEÑOR revistió a Gedeón, y él tocó la trompeta, y los abiezeritas fueron convocados para seguirlo. | Y envió mensajeros por todo Manasés, y también fueron convocados para seguirlo. Y envió mensajeros a Aser, Zabulón y Neftalí, y subieron a encontrarse con ellos. | Entonces Gedeón dijo a Dios: \"Si vas a salvar a Israel por mi mano, como has dicho, | he aquí, pondré un vellón de lana en la era. Si hay rocío solo en el vellón y toda la tierra está seca, entonces sabré que salvarás a Israel por mi mano, como has dicho.\" | Y así fue. Cuando se levantó temprano al día siguiente y exprimió el vellón, sacó suficiente rocío del vellón para llenar un tazón con agua. | Entonces Gedeón dijo a Dios: \"No se encienda tu ira contra mí; permíteme hablar solo una vez más. Por favor, permíteme hacer una prueba más con el vellón. Que solo el vellón esté seco, y en toda la tierra haya rocío.\" | Y Dios lo hizo así esa noche; y solo el vellón estaba seco, y en toda la tierra había rocío.",

El día de tus centinelas, de tu castigo, ha llegado; ahora su confusión está cerca. | No confíes en un vecino; no tengas confianza en un amigo; guarda las puertas de tu boca de la que yace en tus brazos; | porque el hijo trata al padre con desprecio, la hija se levanta contra su madre, la nuera contra su suegra; los enemigos de un hombre son los de su propia casa. | Pero en cuanto a mí, miraré al SEÑOR; esperaré al Dios de mi salvación; mi Dios me escuchará. | No te regocijes sobre mí, oh mi enemigo; cuando caiga, me levantaré; cuando me siente en tinieblas, el SEÑOR será una luz para mí. | Soportaré la indignación del SEÑOR porque he pecado contra él, hasta que defienda mi causa y ejecute juicio por mí.

En ese día el límite se extenderá lejos. | En ese día vendrán a ti, desde Asiria y las ciudades de Egipto, y desde Egipto hasta el Río, de mar a mar y de montaña a montaña. | Pero la tierra estará desolada a causa de sus habitantes, por el fruto de sus obras. | Pastorea a tu pueblo con tu cayado, el rebaño de tu herencia, que habita solo en un bosque en medio de una tierra de jardín; déjalos pastar en Basán y Galaad como en los días de antaño. | Como en los días cuando saliste de la tierra de Egipto, les mostraré cosas maravillosas. | Las naciones verán y se avergonzarán de todo su poder; pondrán sus manos sobre sus bocas; sus oídos quedarán sordos; | lamerán el polvo como una serpiente, como los reptiles de la tierra; saldrán temblando de sus fortalezas; se volverán con temor al SEÑOR nuestro Dios, y temerán de ti. | ¿Quién es un Dios como tú, que perdona la iniquidad y pasa por alto la transgresión del remanente de su herencia? No retiene su ira para siempre, porque se deleita en el amor constante. | Volverá a tener compasión de nosotros; pisoteará nuestras iniquidades. Echarás todos nuestros pecados en las profundidades del mar. | Mostrarás fidelidad a Jacob y amor constante a Abraham, como juraste a nuestros padres desde los días de antaño.",

El nombre de su madre era Jecolía de Jerusalén. | E hizo lo que era correcto ante los ojos del SEÑOR, conforme a todo lo que hizo su padre Amasías. | Y buscó a Dios en los días de Zacarías, quien tenía entendimiento en las visiones de Dios: y mientras buscó al SEÑOR, Dios lo hizo prosperar. | Y salió y guerreó contra los filisteos, y derribó el muro de Gat, y el muro de Jabne, y el muro de Asdod, y construyó ciudades alrededor de Asdod, y entre los filisteos. | Y Dios lo ayudó contra los filisteos, y contra los árabes que habitaban en Gurbaal, y los meunitas. | Y los amonitas dieron regalos a Uzías: y su nombre se extendió hasta la entrada de Egipto; porque se fortaleció en gran manera. | Además, Uzías construyó torres en Jerusalén en la puerta de la esquina, y en la puerta del valle, y en el giro del muro, y las fortificó. | También construyó torres en el desierto, y cavó muchos pozos: porque tenía mucho ganado, tanto en la tierra baja como en las llanuras: también agricultores y viñadores en las montañas, y en el Carmelo: porque amaba la agricultura. | Además, Uzías tenía un ejército de hombres de guerra, que salían a la guerra por grupos, según el número de su cuenta por mano de Jeiel el escriba y Maaseías el gobernante, bajo la mano de Hananías, uno de los capitanes del rey. | El número total de los jefes de los padres de los hombres valientes era de dos mil seiscientos. | Y bajo su mano había un ejército de trescientos mil setecientos cincuenta, que hacían la guerra con gran poder, para ayudar al rey contra el enemigo. | Y Uzías preparó para ellos en todo el ejército escudos, lanzas, cascos, corazas, arcos y hondas para lanzar piedras. | Y hizo en Jerusalén máquinas, inventadas por hombres hábiles, para estar en las torres y en los baluartes, para disparar flechas y grandes piedras. Y su nombre se extendió lejos; porque fue maravillosamente ayudado, hasta que se hizo fuerte. | Pero cuando se hizo fuerte, su corazón se enalteció para su destrucción: porque transgredió contra el SEÑOR su Dios, y entró en el templo del SEÑOR para quemar incienso sobre el altar del incienso. | Y Azarías el sacerdote entró tras él, y con él ochenta sacerdotes del SEÑOR, que eran hombres valientes: | Y se opusieron al rey Uzías, y le dijeron: No te corresponde a ti, Uzías, quemar incienso al SEÑOR, sino a los sacerdotes, los hijos de Aarón, que están consagrados para quemar incienso: sal del santuario; porque has transgredido; ni será para tu honor del SEÑOR Dios. | Entonces Uzías se enojó, y tenía un incensario en su mano para quemar incienso: y mientras se enojaba con los sacerdotes, la lepra le brotó en la frente delante de los sacerdotes en la casa del SEÑOR, junto al altar del incienso. | Y Azarías el sumo sacerdote, y todos los sacerdotes, lo miraron, y he aquí, era leproso en su frente, y lo sacaron de allí; sí, él mismo se apresuró también a salir, porque el SEÑOR lo había herido. | Y el rey Uzías fue leproso hasta el día de su muerte, y vivió en una casa separada, siendo leproso; porque fue apartado de la casa del SEÑOR: y Jotam su hijo estaba sobre la casa del rey, juzgando al pueblo de la tierra. | Ahora, el resto de los actos de Uzías, primero y último, los escribió Isaías el profeta, hijo de Amoz. | Así que Uzías descansó con sus padres, y lo enterraron con sus padres en el campo de sepultura que pertenecía a los reyes; porque dijeron: Es un leproso: y Jotam su hijo reinó en su lugar.",

Su madre se llamaba Jecolía; era de Jerusalén. | Hizo lo que era correcto a los ojos del SEÑOR, tal como lo había hecho su padre Amasías. | Buscó a Dios durante los días de Zacarías, quien lo instruyó en el temor de Dios. Mientras buscó al SEÑOR, Dios le dio éxito. | Fue a la guerra contra los filisteos y derribó los muros de Gat, Jabne y Asdod. Luego reconstruyó ciudades cerca de Asdod y en otros lugares entre los filisteos. | Dios lo ayudó contra los filisteos y contra los árabes que vivían en Gur Baal y contra los meunitas. | Los amonitas trajeron tributo a Uzías, y su fama se extendió hasta la frontera de Egipto, porque se había vuelto muy poderoso. | Uzías construyó torres en Jerusalén en la Puerta de la Esquina, en la Puerta del Valle y en el ángulo del muro, y las fortificó. | También construyó torres en el desierto y cavó muchas cisternas, porque tenía mucho ganado en las colinas y en la llanura. Tenía gente trabajando sus campos y viñedos en las colinas y en las tierras fértiles, porque amaba la tierra. | Uzías tenía un ejército bien entrenado, listo para salir por divisiones según sus números, como fueron contados por Jeiel el secretario y Maaseías el oficial bajo la dirección de Hananías, uno de los oficiales reales. | El número total de líderes de familia sobre los hombres de guerra era de 2,600. | Bajo su mando había un ejército de 307,500 hombres entrenados para la guerra, una fuerza poderosa para apoyar al rey contra sus enemigos. | Uzías proporcionó escudos, lanzas, cascos, corazas, arcos y piedras de honda para todo el ejército. | En Jerusalén hizo máquinas diseñadas por hombres hábiles para usar en las torres y en las defensas de las esquinas para disparar flechas y lanzar grandes piedras. Su fama se extendió por todas partes, porque fue grandemente ayudado hasta que se hizo poderoso. | Pero después de que Uzías se hizo poderoso, su orgullo lo llevó a su caída. Fue infiel al SEÑOR su Dios, y entró en el templo del SEÑOR para quemar incienso en el altar del incienso. | Azarías el sacerdote con otros ochenta sacerdotes valientes del SEÑOR lo siguieron. | Lo confrontaron y le dijeron: \"No es correcto que tú, Uzías, quemes incienso al SEÑOR. Eso es para los sacerdotes, los descendientes de Aarón, que han sido consagrados para quemar incienso. Sal del santuario, porque has sido infiel; y no serás honrado por el SEÑOR Dios.\" | Uzías, que tenía un incensario en la mano listo para quemar incienso, se enojó. Mientras estaba furioso con los sacerdotes en su presencia ante el altar del incienso en el templo del SEÑOR, la lepra brotó en su frente. | Cuando Azarías el sumo sacerdote y todos los demás sacerdotes lo miraron, vieron que tenía lepra en la frente, así que lo sacaron rápidamente. De hecho, él mismo estaba ansioso por salir, porque el SEÑOR lo había afligido. | El rey Uzías tuvo lepra hasta el día de su muerte. Vivió en una casa separada -leproso, y excluido del templo del SEÑOR. Jotam su hijo estaba a cargo del palacio y gobernaba al pueblo de la tierra. | Los otros eventos del reinado de Uzías, desde el principio hasta el fin, están registrados por el profeta Isaías hijo de Amoz. | Uzías descansó con sus padres y fue enterrado cerca de ellos en un campo de sepultura que pertenecía a los reyes, porque la gente decía: \"Tenía lepra.\" Y Jotam su hijo lo sucedió como rey.",

He also had plowmen and vinedressers in the hill country and the fertile fields, for he loved the soil.|Moreover, Uzziah had an army ready for battle, which entered combat by divisions according to the number of their muster, recorded by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the official, under the direction of Hananiah, one of the king's officers.|The total number of the heads of the households, of valiant warriors, was 2,600.|Under their direction was an army of 307,500, who could wage war with great power, to help the king against the enemy.|Moreover, Uzziah prepared for all the army shields, spears, helmets, body armor, bows, and slingstones.|In Jerusalem he made machines of war invented by skillful workmen to be on the towers and the corners, for the purpose of shooting arrows and great stones. So his fame spread far, for he was marvelously helped until he was strong.\nPride Is Uzziah's Undoing|But when he became strong, his heart was so proud that he acted corruptly, and he was untrue to the Lord his God, for he entered the temple of the Lord to burn incense on the altar of incense.|Then Azariah the priest entered after him, and with him eighty priests of the Lord, valiant men.|They opposed Uzziah the king and said to him, \"It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the Lord, but for the priests, the sons of Aaron who have been consecrated to burn incense. Leave the sanctuary, for you have been untrue and will have no honor from the Lord God.\"|But Uzziah, with a censer in his hand for burning incense, was enraged; and while he was enraged with the priests, leprosy broke out on his forehead in the presence of the priests in the house of the Lord, beside the altar of incense.|Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him, and behold, he was leprous on his forehead; and they quickly removed him from there, and he himself also hurried to get out because the Lord had stricken him.|King Uzziah had leprosy to the day of his death; and he lived in a separate house, afflicted as he was with leprosy, for he was cut off from the house of the Lord. And his son Jotham was over the king's house, judging the people of the land.|Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, the first to the last, the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, has written.|So Uzziah lay down with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the grave which belonged to the kings, for they said, \"He had leprosy.\" And his son Jotham became king in his place.",

Tenía cinco años cuando llegaron las noticias sobre Saúl y Jonatán desde Jezreel; y su nodriza lo tomó y huyó. Y sucedió que, mientras se apresuraba a huir, él cayó y quedó cojo. Su nombre era Mefiboset. | Entonces los hijos de Rimón el Beerotita, Recab y Baaná, partieron y llegaron, al calor del día, a la casa de Isboset, que estaba acostado en su cama al mediodía. | Y entraron allí, hasta dentro de la casa, como para recoger trigo, y lo apuñalaron en el estómago. Luego Recab y Baaná, su hermano, escaparon. | Porque cuando entraron en la casa, él estaba acostado en su cama en su dormitorio; entonces lo golpearon y lo mataron, le cortaron la cabeza, y se llevaron su cabeza, y estuvieron toda la noche escapando por la llanura. | Y llevaron la cabeza de Isboset a David en Hebrón, y dijeron al rey: \"Aquí está la cabeza de Isboset, el hijo de Saúl, tu enemigo, que buscaba tu vida; y el Señor ha vengado hoy a mi señor el rey de Saúl y de sus descendientes.\" | Pero David respondió a Recab y a Baaná, su hermano, los hijos de Rimón el Beerotita, y les dijo: \"Vive el Señor, que ha redimido mi vida de toda adversidad,\" | \"cuando alguien me dijo, diciendo, 'Mira, Saúl ha muerto,' pensando que traía buenas noticias, lo arresté y lo hice ejecutar en Ziklag—al que pensó que le daría una recompensa por sus noticias.\" | \"¿Cuánto más, cuando hombres malvados han matado a una persona justa en su propia casa en su cama? Por lo tanto, ¿no exigiré ahora su sangre de sus manos y los eliminaré de la tierra?\" | Así que David ordenó a sus jóvenes, y los ejecutaron, les cortaron las manos y los pies, y los colgaron junto al estanque en Hebrón. Pero tomaron la cabeza de Isboset y la enterraron en la tumba de Abner en Hebrón.",

Cavó muchos pozos, porque tenía mucho ganado, tanto en las tierras bajas como en las llanuras; también tenía agricultores y viñadores en las montañas y en el Carmelo, porque amaba la tierra. | Además, Uzías tenía un ejército de hombres de guerra, que salían a la guerra por compañías, según el número en su lista preparado por Jeiel el escriba y Maaseías el oficial, bajo la mano de Hananías, uno de los capitanes del rey. | El número total de oficiales principales de los hombres valientes era de dos mil seiscientos. | Bajo su autoridad había un ejército de trescientos siete mil quinientos que hacían la guerra con gran poder, para ayudar al rey contra el enemigo. | Entonces Uzías preparó para ellos, para todo el ejército, escudos, lanzas, cascos, armaduras, arcos y hondas para lanzar piedras. | Y hizo dispositivos en Jerusalén, inventados por hombres hábiles, para estar en las torres y en las esquinas, para disparar flechas y grandes piedras. Así que su fama se extendió por todas partes, porque fue maravillosamente ayudado hasta que se hizo fuerte. | Pero cuando se hizo fuerte, su corazón se enalteció, para su destrucción, porque transgredió contra el Señor su Dios al entrar en el templo del Señor para quemar incienso en el altar del incienso. | Entonces el sacerdote Azarías entró tras él, y con él ochenta sacerdotes del Señor, hombres valientes. | Y se enfrentaron al rey Uzías, y le dijeron: “No te corresponde a ti, Uzías, quemar incienso al Señor, sino a los sacerdotes, los hijos de Aarón, que están consagrados para quemar incienso. ¡Sal del santuario, porque has transgredido! No tendrás honor del Señor Dios.” | Entonces Uzías se enfureció; y tenía un incensario en su mano para quemar incienso. Y mientras estaba enojado con los sacerdotes, la lepra brotó en su frente, delante de los sacerdotes en la casa del Señor, junto al altar del incienso. | Y Azarías el sumo sacerdote y todos los sacerdotes lo miraron, y allí, en su frente, estaba leproso; así que lo sacaron de ese lugar. De hecho, él también se apresuró a salir, porque el Señor lo había herido. | El rey Uzías fue leproso hasta el día de su muerte. Vivió en una casa aislada, porque era leproso; porque fue apartado de la casa del Señor. Entonces Jotam su hijo estaba sobre la casa del rey, juzgando al pueblo de la tierra. | Ahora el resto de los actos de Uzías, desde el primero hasta el último, los escribió el profeta Isaías hijo de Amoz. | Así que Uzías descansó con sus padres, y lo enterraron con sus padres en el campo de sepultura que pertenecía a los reyes, porque dijeron: “Es un leproso.” Entonces Jotam su hijo reinó en su lugar.",

Puso a Joás y a su nodriza en un dormitorio, y lo escondieron de Atalía, así que el niño no fue asesinado. | Joás permaneció escondido en el Templo del Señor durante seis años mientras Atalía gobernaba la tierra. | En el séptimo año del reinado de Atalía, el sacerdote Joiada convocó a los comandantes, a los mercenarios caritas y a los guardias del palacio para que vinieran al Templo del Señor. Hizo un pacto solemne con ellos y les hizo jurar lealtad allí en el Templo del Señor; luego les mostró al hijo del rey. | Joiada les dijo: “Esto es lo que deben hacer.

También hizo un pacto entre el rey y el pueblo. | Entonces toda la gente de la tierra fue al templo de Baal y lo derribaron. Demolieron los altares y destrozaron los ídolos, y mataron a Matán, el sacerdote de Baal, frente a los altares.

Su madre era Jecolías de Jerusalén. | Hizo lo que era agradable a los ojos del Señor, tal como lo había hecho su padre, Amasías. | Uzías buscó a Dios durante los días de Zacarías, quien le enseñó a temer a Dios. Y mientras el rey buscó la guía del Señor, Dios le dio éxito. | Uzías declaró la guerra a los filisteos y derribó los muros de Gat, Jabne y Asdod. Luego construyó nuevas ciudades en el área de Asdod y en otras partes de Filistea. | Dios lo ayudó en sus guerras contra los filisteos, sus batallas con los árabes de Gur y sus guerras con los meunitas. | Los meunitas le pagaban tributo anual, y su fama se extendió incluso hasta Egipto, porque se había vuelto muy poderoso. | Uzías construyó torres fortificadas en Jerusalén en la Puerta de la Esquina, en la Puerta del Valle y en el ángulo del muro. También construyó fortalezas en el desierto y cavó muchas cisternas de agua, porque mantenía grandes rebaños de ganado en las colinas de Judá y en las llanuras. También era un hombre que amaba la tierra. Tenía muchos trabajadores que cuidaban sus granjas y viñedos, tanto en las laderas como en los valles fértiles. | Uzías tenía un ejército bien organizado, listo para salir a la batalla unidad por unidad. Este ejército había sido reunido y organizado por Jeiel, el secretario del ejército, y su asistente, Maaseías. Estaban bajo la dirección de Hananías, uno de los oficiales del rey. | Estos regimientos de poderosos guerreros estaban comandados por 2,600 líderes de clanes. | El ejército consistía en 307,500 hombres, todos tropas de élite. Estaban preparados para asistir al rey contra cualquier enemigo. | Uzías proporcionó a todo el ejército escudos, lanzas, cascos, cotas de malla, arcos y piedras de honda. | Y construyó estructuras en los muros de Jerusalén, diseñadas por expertos para proteger a los que disparaban flechas y lanzaban grandes piedras desde las torres y las esquinas del muro. Su fama se extendió por todas partes, porque el Señor le dio una ayuda maravillosa, y se volvió muy poderoso. | Pero cuando se volvió poderoso, también se volvió orgulloso, lo que lo llevó a su caída. Pecó contra el Señor su Dios al entrar en el santuario del Templo del Señor y quemar incienso personalmente en el altar del incienso. | Azarías, el sumo sacerdote, entró tras él con otros ochenta sacerdotes del Señor, todos hombres valientes. | Confrontaron al rey Uzías y le dijeron: “No te corresponde a ti, Uzías, quemar incienso al Señor. Esa es la labor de los sacerdotes solamente, los descendientes de Aarón, que están apartados para este trabajo. ¡Sal del santuario, porque has pecado. El Señor Dios no te honrará por esto!” | Uzías, que sostenía un incensario, se enfureció. Pero mientras estaba allí enfurecido contra los sacerdotes ante el altar del incienso en el Templo del Señor, la lepra brotó repentinamente en su frente. | Cuando Azarías y los otros sacerdotes vieron la lepra, lo sacaron rápidamente. Y el rey mismo estaba ansioso por salir porque el Señor lo había golpeado. | Así que el rey Uzías tuvo lepra hasta el día de su muerte. Vivió en aislamiento en una casa separada, porque fue excluido del Templo del Señor. Su hijo Jotam fue puesto a cargo del palacio real, y gobernó al pueblo de la tierra. | El resto de los eventos del reinado de Uzías, desde el principio hasta el fin, están registrados por el profeta Isaías, hijo de Amoz. | Cuando Uzías murió, fue enterrado con sus antepasados; su tumba estaba en un campo de entierro cercano perteneciente a los reyes, porque la gente decía: “Tenía lepra”. Y su hijo Jotam se convirtió en el siguiente rey.",

Así fue escondido de Atalía y no fue asesinado. | Joás estuvo escondido con ella en el templo del Señor durante seis años mientras Atalía reinaba sobre la tierra. | En el séptimo año, Joiada mandó llamar a los comandantes de cientos, a los caritas y a los guardias. Los hizo venir a él en el templo del Señor, donde hizo un pacto con ellos y los puso bajo juramento. Les mostró al hijo del rey | y les ordenó: “Esto es lo que deben hacer: Un tercio de ustedes que entran de servicio en el sábado deben proporcionar protección para el palacio del rey. | Un tercio debe estar en la Puerta de los Cimientos y un tercio en la puerta detrás de los guardias. Deben turnarse para proporcionar protección al palacio. | Las dos unidades de ustedes que están fuera de servicio en el sábado deben guardar el templo para el rey. | Rodeen completamente al rey y tengan armas en mano. Cualquiera que se acerque a las filas debe ser muerto. Estén con el rey en todas sus tareas diarias.” | Así que los comandantes de cientos hicieron todo lo que el sacerdote Joiada ordenó. Cada uno trajo a sus hombres—los que entraban de servicio en el sábado y los que salían de servicio—y fueron al sacerdote Joiada. | El sacerdote dio a los comandantes de cientos las lanzas y escudos del rey David que estaban en el templo del Señor. | Luego los guardias se colocaron con sus armas en mano rodeando al rey—desde el lado derecho del templo hasta el lado izquierdo, junto al altar y junto al templo. | Sacaron al hijo del rey, le pusieron la corona, le dieron el testimonio y lo hicieron rey. Lo ungieron y aplaudieron y gritaron: “¡Viva el rey!” | Cuando Atalía oyó el ruido de los guardias y de la multitud, salió hacia el pueblo en el templo del Señor. | Miró, y allí estaba el rey de pie junto a la columna según la costumbre. Los comandantes y los trompetistas estaban junto al rey, y todo el pueblo de la tierra se regocijaba y tocaba trompetas. Atalía rasgó sus vestiduras y gritó: “¡Traición! ¡Traición!” | Entonces el sacerdote Joiada ordenó a los comandantes de cientos a cargo del ejército: “Sáquenla entre las filas, y maten a espada a cualquiera que la siga,” porque el sacerdote había dicho: “No debe ser muerta en el templo del Señor.” | Así que la arrestaron, y ella pasó por la entrada de los caballos al palacio del rey, donde fue ejecutada. | Luego Joiada hizo un pacto entre el Señor, el rey y el pueblo de que serían el pueblo del Señor y otro pacto entre el rey y el pueblo. | Así que todo el pueblo de la tierra fue al templo de Baal y lo derribaron. Destruyeron sus altares e imágenes en pedazos y mataron a Matán, el sacerdote de Baal, en los altares. Luego el sacerdote Joiada designó guardias para el templo del Señor. | Tomó a los comandantes de cientos, a los caritas, a los guardias y a todo el pueblo de la tierra, y llevaron al rey desde el templo del Señor. Entraron al palacio del rey por la puerta de los guardias. Entonces Joás se sentó en el trono de los reyes. | Todo el pueblo de la tierra se regocijó, y la ciudad estaba tranquila, porque habían matado a Atalía a espada en el palacio del rey. | Joás tenía siete años cuando se convirtió en rey.",

Su madre se llamaba Jecolías, de Jerusalén. | Hizo lo que era correcto a los ojos del Señor, como había hecho su padre Amasías. | Buscó a Dios durante toda la vida de Zacarías, el maestro del temor de Dios. Durante el tiempo que buscó al Señor, Dios le dio éxito. | Uzías salió a hacer guerra contra los filisteos y derribó el muro de Gat, el muro de Jabne y el muro de Asdod. Construyó ciudades en los alrededores de Asdod y entre los filisteos. | Dios lo ayudó contra los filisteos, los árabes que viven en Gur-baal, y los meunitas. | Los amonitas le pagaron tributo a Uzías, y su fama se extendió hasta la entrada de Egipto, porque Dios lo hizo muy poderoso. | Uzías construyó torres en Jerusalén en la Puerta de la Esquina, la Puerta del Valle y el contrafuerte de la esquina, y las fortificó. | Como tenía mucho ganado tanto en las colinas de Judea como en la llanura, construyó torres en el desierto y cavó muchos pozos. Y como era amante de la tierra, tenía agricultores y viñadores en las colinas y en las tierras fértiles. | Uzías tenía un ejército equipado para el combate que salía a la guerra por divisiones según sus asignaciones, como lo registraron Jeiel, el secretario de la corte, y Maaseías, el oficial bajo la autoridad de Hananías, uno de los comandantes del rey. | El número total de jefes de familia era de dos mil seiscientos valientes guerreros. | Bajo su autoridad había un ejército de 307,500 equipados para la guerra, una fuerza poderosa para ayudar al rey contra el enemigo. | Uzías proporcionó a todo el ejército escudos, lanzas, cascos, armaduras, arcos y piedras de honda. | Hizo dispositivos diseñados hábilmente en Jerusalén para disparar flechas y catapultar grandes piedras para usar en las torres y en las esquinas. Así que su fama se extendió incluso a lugares lejanos, porque fue maravillosamente ayudado hasta que se hizo fuerte. | Pero cuando se hizo fuerte, se volvió arrogante, y eso lo llevó a su propia destrucción. Actuó infielmente contra el Señor su Dios al entrar en el santuario del Señor para quemar incienso en el altar del incienso. | El sacerdote Azarías, junto con ochenta valientes sacerdotes del Señor, entraron tras él. | Se enfrentaron al rey Uzías y le dijeron: “Uzías, no tienes derecho a ofrecer incienso al Señor; solo los sacerdotes consagrados, los descendientes de Aarón, tienen derecho a ofrecer incienso. Sal del santuario, porque has actuado infielmente. No recibirás honor del Señor Dios.” | Uzías, con un incensario en la mano para ofrecer incienso, se enfureció; pero cuando se enfureció con los sacerdotes, en presencia de los sacerdotes en el templo del Señor junto al altar del incienso, una enfermedad de la piel brotó en su frente. | Cuando Azarías, el sumo sacerdote, y todos los sacerdotes se volvieron hacia él, vieron que estaba enfermo en la frente. Lo sacaron rápidamente de allí; él mismo también se apresuró a salir porque el Señor lo había afligido. | Así que el rey Uzías estuvo enfermo hasta el momento de su muerte. Vivió en cuarentena con una grave enfermedad de la piel y fue excluido del acceso al templo del Señor, mientras su hijo Jotam estaba a cargo de la casa del rey gobernando al pueblo de la tierra. | Ahora el profeta Isaías, hijo de Amoz, escribió el resto de los eventos del reinado de Uzías, desde el principio hasta el fin. | Uzías descansó con sus antepasados, y fue enterrado con sus antepasados en el cementerio de los reyes, porque dijeron: “Tiene una enfermedad de la piel.” Su hijo Jotam se convirtió en rey en su lugar.",

El nombre de su madre era Jecolía, de Jerusalén. | Hizo lo que era correcto a los ojos del Señor, como lo había hecho su padre Amasías. | Buscó a Dios durante toda la vida de Zacarías, el maestro del temor de Dios. Durante el tiempo que buscó al Señor, Dios le dio éxito. | Uzías salió a guerrear contra los filisteos y derribó el muro de Gat, el muro de Jabne y el muro de Asdod. Construyó ciudades en los alrededores de Asdod y entre los filisteos. | Dios lo ayudó contra los filisteos, los árabes que viven en Gur-baal, y los meunitas. | Los amonitas le pagaron tributo a Uzías, y su fama se extendió hasta la entrada de Egipto, porque Dios lo hizo muy poderoso. | Uzías construyó torres en Jerusalén en la Puerta de la Esquina, la Puerta del Valle y el contrafuerte de la esquina, y las fortificó. | Como tenía mucho ganado tanto en las llanuras de Judá como en la llanura, construyó torres en el desierto y cavó muchos pozos. Y como era amante de la tierra, tenía agricultores y viñadores en las colinas y en las tierras fértiles. | Uzías tenía un ejército equipado para el combate que salía a la guerra por divisiones según sus asignaciones, como lo registraron Jeiel, el secretario de la corte, y Maaseías, el oficial bajo la autoridad de Hananías, uno de los comandantes del rey. | El número total de jefes de familia era de dos mil seiscientos valientes guerreros. | Bajo su autoridad había un ejército de 307,500 equipados para la guerra, una fuerza poderosa para ayudar al rey contra el enemigo. | Uzías proporcionó a todo el ejército escudos, lanzas, cascos, armaduras, arcos y piedras de honda. | Hizo dispositivos hábilmente diseñados en Jerusalén para disparar flechas y catapultar grandes piedras para usarlas en las torres y en las esquinas. Así que su fama se extendió incluso a lugares lejanos, porque fue maravillosamente ayudado hasta que se hizo fuerte. | Pero cuando se hizo fuerte, se volvió arrogante, y eso lo llevó a su propia destrucción. Actuó infielmente contra el Señor su Dios al entrar en el santuario del Señor para quemar incienso en el altar del incienso. | El sacerdote Azarías, junto con ochenta valientes sacerdotes del Señor, entraron tras él. | Se enfrentaron al rey Uzías y le dijeron: “Uzías, no tienes derecho a ofrecer incienso al Señor; solo los sacerdotes consagrados, los descendientes de Aarón, tienen derecho a ofrecer incienso. Sal del santuario, porque has actuado infielmente. No recibirás honor del Señor Dios.” | Uzías, con un incensario en la mano para ofrecer incienso, se enfureció; pero cuando se enfureció con los sacerdotes, en presencia de los sacerdotes en el templo del Señor junto al altar del incienso, una enfermedad de la piel brotó en su frente. | Cuando Azarías, el sumo sacerdote, y todos los sacerdotes se volvieron hacia él, vieron que estaba enfermo en la frente. Lo sacaron rápidamente de allí; él mismo también se apresuró a salir porque el Señor lo había afligido. | Así que el rey Uzías estuvo enfermo hasta el momento de su muerte. Vivió en cuarentena con una grave enfermedad de la piel y fue excluido del acceso al templo del Señor, mientras su hijo Jotam estaba a cargo de la casa del rey gobernando al pueblo de la tierra. | Ahora el profeta Isaías, hijo de Amoz, escribió el resto de los eventos del reinado de Uzías, desde el principio hasta el fin. | Uzías descansó con sus antepasados, y fue enterrado con sus antepasados en el cementerio de los reyes, porque dijeron: “Tiene una enfermedad de la piel.” Su hijo Jotam se convirtió en rey en su lugar.",

Zacarías le enseñó a tener respeto por Dios. Mientras Uzías buscó al Señor, Dios le dio éxito. | Uzías fue a la guerra contra los filisteos. Derribó los muros de Gat, Jabne y Asdod. Construyó ciudades cerca de Asdod y en otros lugares entre los filisteos. | Dios lo ayudó a luchar contra los filisteos, los árabes que vivían en Gur Baal y los meunitas. | Los amonitas trajeron regalos a Uzías. Su poder se hizo más fuerte. Se extendió hasta la frontera de Egipto. | Uzías construyó torres en Jerusalén. Las construyó en la Puerta de la Esquina, en la Puerta del Valle y en el ángulo del muro. Las hizo muy fuertes. | Construyó torres en el desierto. Cavó muchos pozos. Eso fue porque tenía muchos rebaños de ganado. Estaban en las colinas occidentales y en las llanuras. Tenía gente trabajando en sus campos y viñedos en las colinas y en la tierra fértil. Amaba la tierra. | Uzías tenía un gran ejército de soldados. Estaban bien entrenados. Su número total estaba registrado en los archivos de Jeiel, el secretario. Maaseías era su oficial. Hananías, uno de los oficiales del rey, era su comandante. | El número total de líderes de familia que estaban sobre los hombres de guerra era de 2,600. | Bajo ellos había un ejército de 307,500 hombres. Luchaban con gran poder. Ayudaban al rey a luchar contra sus enemigos. | Uzías equipó a todo el ejército con escudos, lanzas, cascos, corazas, arcos y piedras para sus hondas. | En Jerusalén hizo máquinas diseñadas para disparar flechas y lanzar grandes piedras. Las colocó en las torres y en las esquinas del muro de la ciudad. Se hizo famoso en todas partes. El Señor lo ayudó mucho hasta que se hizo poderoso. | Pero después de que Uzías se hizo poderoso, su orgullo lo derribó. No fue fiel al Señor su Dios. Entró en el templo del Señor para quemar incienso en el altar de incienso. | Azarías el sacerdote lo siguió. También lo hicieron otros 80 valientes sacerdotes del Señor. | Se enfrentaron a Uzías. Dijeron: “No es correcto que tú quemes incienso al Señor. Eso es para los sacerdotes, los hijos de Aarón. Han sido apartados para quemar incienso. Sal del lugar santo. No has sido fiel. El Señor Dios no te honrará.” | Uzías sostenía una copa poco profunda. Estaba listo para quemar incienso. Se enojó. Mientras gritaba a los sacerdotes en el templo del Señor, Dios lo golpeó con una enfermedad de la piel. Apareció en su frente. Sucedió justo delante de los sacerdotes. Sucedió en la casa del Señor cerca del altar de incienso. | Azarías el sumo sacerdote y todos los demás sacerdotes lo miraron. Vieron que tenía una enfermedad de la piel en la frente. Así que lo sacaron rápidamente. Eso fue porque el Señor lo había golpeado. Uzías mismo tenía prisa por salir. | Uzías tuvo la enfermedad de la piel hasta el día de su muerte. Vivió en una casa separada. No se le permitió entrar en el templo del Señor. Su hijo Jotam estaba a cargo del palacio. Jotam gobernó al pueblo de la tierra. | Los otros eventos del reinado de Uzías desde el principio hasta el fin fueron escritos por el profeta Isaías. Isaías era hijo de Amoz. | Uzías se unió a los miembros de su familia que ya habían muerto. La gente enterró su cuerpo cerca de ellos en un campo que pertenecía a los reyes. Dijeron: “Tenía una enfermedad de la piel.” Su hijo Jotam se convirtió en el siguiente rey después de él.",

Su fama se extendió hasta la entrada de Egipto, porque se hizo extremadamente fuerte. | Y Uzías construyó torres en Jerusalén en la Puerta de la Esquina, en la Puerta del Valle, y en el contrafuerte de la esquina del muro; luego las fortificó. | También construyó torres en el desierto.

No tendrás honor del Señor Dios.” | Entonces Uzías se enfureció; y tenía un incensario en su mano para quemar incienso.

      "ChapterText": "Cuando Atalía, la madre del rey Ocozías de Judá, se enteró de que su hijo había muerto, comenzó a destruir al resto de la familia real. | Pero la hermana de Ocozías, Josaba, la hija del rey Joram, tomó al hijo pequeño de Ocozías, Joás, y lo sacó de entre los demás hijos del rey, que estaban a punto de ser asesinados. Puso a Joás y a su nodriza en un dormitorio, y lo escondieron de Atalía, así que el niño no fue asesinado. | Joás permaneció escondido en el Templo del Señor durante seis años mientras Atalía gobernaba el país. | En el séptimo año del reinado de Atalía, el sacerdote Joiada convocó a los comandantes, a los mercenarios caritas y a los guardias del palacio para que vinieran al Templo del Señor. Hizo un pacto solemne con ellos y les hizo jurar lealtad allí en el Templo del Señor; luego les mostró al hijo del rey. | Joiada les dijo: “Esto es lo que deben hacer. Un tercio de ustedes que están de guardia en el sábado deben proteger el palacio real mismo. | Otro tercio de ustedes debe hacer guardia en la Puerta de Sur, y el último tercio debe hacer guardia detrás de los guardias del palacio como protección para el palacio. | Los otros dos grupos que están fuera de servicio en el sábado deben hacer guardia para el rey en el Templo del Señor. | Formen una escolta alrededor del rey y mantengan sus armas en mano. Maten a cualquiera que intente pasar. Permanezcan con el rey dondequiera que vaya.” | Así que los comandantes hicieron todo lo que el sacerdote Joiada ordenó. Los comandantes llevaron a sus hombres—los que estaban de guardia ese sábado y los que estaban fuera de servicio—y los llevaron ante el sacerdote Joiada. | Y Joiada suministró a los comandantes las lanzas y los escudos pequeños que una vez pertenecieron al rey David y que estaban guardados en el Templo del Señor. | Los guardias del palacio se apostaron alrededor del rey con sus armas listas. Formaron una línea desde el lado sur del Templo hasta el lado norte y alrededor del altar. | Luego Joiada sacó a Joás, el hijo del rey, le puso la corona en la cabeza y le presentó una copia de las leyes de Dios. Lo ungieron y lo proclamaron rey, y todos aplaudieron y gritaron: “¡Viva el rey!” | Cuando Atalía escuchó el ruido que hacían los guardias del palacio y la gente, se apresuró al Templo del Señor para ver qué estaba pasando. | Cuando llegó, vio al rey recién coronado de pie en su lugar de autoridad junto a la columna, como era costumbre en los tiempos de coronación. Los comandantes y trompetistas lo rodeaban, y gente de todo el país estaba celebrando y tocando trompetas. Atalía rasgó sus vestiduras y gritó: “¡Traición! ¡Traición!” | Entonces el sacerdote Joiada ordenó a los comandantes que estaban a cargo de las tropas: “Llévenla a los soldados frente al Templo, y maten a cualquiera que intente rescatarla.” Porque el sacerdote había dicho: “No debe ser asesinada en el Templo del Señor.” | Así que la apresaron y la llevaron a la puerta por donde los caballos entran a los terrenos del palacio, y allí fue asesinada. | Luego Joiada hizo un pacto entre el Señor y el rey y el pueblo para que fueran el pueblo del Señor. También hizo un pacto entre el rey y el pueblo. | Entonces toda la gente del país fue al templo de Baal y lo derribaron. Demolieron los altares y destrozaron los ídolos, y mataron a Matán, el sacerdote de Baal, frente a los altares. El sacerdote Joiada colocó guardias en el Templo del Señor. | Luego los comandantes, los mercenarios caritas, los guardias del palacio y toda la gente del país escoltaron al rey desde el Templo del Señor. Pasaron por la puerta de los guardias y entraron al palacio, y el rey tomó asiento en el trono real. | Así que toda la gente del país se regocijó, y la ciudad estaba en paz porque Atalía había sido asesinada en el palacio del rey. | Joás tenía siete años cuando se convirtió en rey.",

      "ChapterText": "Ahora, en el día veinticuatro de este mes, los hijos de Israel se reunieron con ayuno, vestidos de cilicio y con tierra sobre ellos. | Y la descendencia de Israel se separó de todos los extranjeros, y se pusieron de pie y confesaron sus pecados y las iniquidades de sus padres. | Y se levantaron en su lugar, y leyeron en el libro de la ley del SEÑOR su Dios una cuarta parte del día; y otra cuarta parte confesaron y adoraron al SEÑOR su Dios. | Entonces se levantaron sobre las gradas, de los levitas, Jesúa, y Bani, Cadmiel, Sebanías, Buni, Serebías, Bani, y Quenaní, y clamaron en alta voz al SEÑOR su Dios. | Luego los levitas, Jesúa, y Cadmiel, Bani, Hasabnías, Serebías, Hodías, Sebanías, y Petahías, dijeron: Levantaos y bendecid al SEÑOR vuestro Dios por los siglos de los siglos: y bendito sea tu glorioso nombre, que está exaltado sobre toda bendición y alabanza. | Tú, solo tú, eres SEÑOR; tú hiciste el cielo, el cielo de los cielos, con todo su ejército, la tierra, y todo lo que hay en ella, los mares, y todo lo que hay en ellos, y tú los preservas a todos; y el ejército del cielo te adora. | Tú eres el SEÑOR el Dios, que escogiste a Abram, y lo sacaste de Ur de los caldeos, y le diste el nombre de Abraham; | Y hallaste su corazón fiel delante de ti, e hiciste un pacto con él para darle la tierra de los cananeos, los hititas, los amorreos, los ferezeos, los jebuseos, y los gergeseos, para darla, digo, a su descendencia, y has cumplido tus palabras; porque tú eres justo: | Y viste la aflicción de nuestros padres en Egipto, y oíste su clamor junto al Mar Rojo; | Y mostraste señales y maravillas sobre Faraón, y sobre todos sus siervos, y sobre todo el pueblo de su tierra: porque sabías que se ensoberbecieron contra ellos. Así te hiciste un nombre, como en este día. | Y dividiste el mar delante de ellos, de modo que pasaron por en medio del mar en tierra seca; y a sus perseguidores los arrojaste a las profundidades, como una piedra en las aguas poderosas. | Además los guiaste de día con una columna de nube; y de noche con una columna de fuego, para darles luz en el camino por donde debían ir. | También descendiste sobre el monte Sinaí, y hablaste con ellos desde el cielo, y les diste juicios rectos, y leyes verdaderas, buenos estatutos y mandamientos: | Y les diste a conocer tu santo sábado, y les ordenaste preceptos, estatutos y leyes, por mano de Moisés tu siervo: | Y les diste pan del cielo para su hambre, y sacaste agua de la roca para su sed, y les prometiste que entrarían a poseer la tierra que habías jurado darles. | Pero ellos y nuestros padres se ensoberbecieron, y endurecieron su cerviz, y no escucharon tus mandamientos, | Y rehusaron obedecer, ni se acordaron de tus maravillas que hiciste entre ellos; sino que endurecieron su cerviz, y en su rebelión designaron un capitán para volver a su esclavitud: pero tú eres un Dios dispuesto a perdonar, clemente y misericordioso, lento para la ira, y de gran bondad, y no los abandonaste. | Sí, cuando se hicieron un becerro de fundición, y dijeron: Este es tu Dios que te sacó de Egipto, y cometieron grandes provocaciones; | Sin embargo, en tus muchas misericordias no los abandonaste en el desierto: la columna de nube no se apartó de ellos de día, para guiarlos en el camino; ni la columna de fuego de noche, para mostrarles luz, y el camino por donde debían ir. | También les diste tu buen espíritu para instruirlos, y no les negaste tu maná de su boca, y les diste agua para su sed. | Sí, cuarenta años los sustentaste en el desierto, de modo que no les faltó nada; sus vestidos no se envejecieron, y sus pies no se hincharon. | Además les diste reinos y naciones, y los dividiste en rincones: así poseyeron la tierra de Sehón, y la tierra del rey de Hesbón, y la tierra de Og rey de Basán. | También multiplicaste sus hijos como las estrellas del cielo, y los llevaste a la tierra, de la cual habías prometido a sus padres, que entrarían a poseerla. | Así los hijos entraron y poseyeron la tierra, y sometiste delante de ellos a los habitantes de la tierra, los cananeos, y los entregaste en sus manos, con sus reyes, y el pueblo de la tierra, para que hicieran con ellos lo que quisieran. | Y tomaron ciudades fortificadas, y una tierra fértil, y poseyeron casas llenas de toda clase de bienes, cisternas cavadas, viñas, y olivares, y árboles frutales en abundancia: así comieron, y se saciaron, y se engordaron, y se deleitaron en tu gran bondad. | Sin embargo, fueron desobedientes, y se rebelaron contra ti, y echaron tu ley tras sus espaldas, y mataron a tus profetas que testificaban contra ellos para hacerlos volver a ti, y cometieron grandes provocaciones. | Por lo tanto, los entregaste en manos de sus enemigos, que los afligieron: y en el tiempo de su angustia, cuando clamaron a ti, los oíste desde el cielo; y según tus muchas misericordias les diste salvadores, que los salvaron de la mano de sus enemigos. | Pero después de que tuvieron descanso, volvieron a hacer el mal delante de ti: por lo tanto, los dejaste en la tierra de sus enemigos, para que tuvieran dominio sobre ellos: sin embargo, cuando regresaron, y clamaron a ti, los oíste desde el cielo; y muchas veces los libraste según tus misericordias; | Y testificaste contra ellos, para hacerlos volver a tu ley: pero se ensoberbecieron, y no escucharon tus mandamientos, sino que pecaron contra tus juicios, (que si un hombre los hace, vivirá en ellos;) y retiraron el hombro, y endurecieron su cerviz, y no quisieron escuchar. | Sin embargo, muchos años los soportaste, y testificaste contra ellos por tu espíritu en tus profetas: pero no quisieron escuchar: por lo tanto, los entregaste en manos de los pueblos de las tierras. | Sin embargo, por tus grandes misericordias no los consumiste del todo, ni los abandonaste; porque tú eres un Dios clemente y misericordioso. | Ahora, pues, nuestro Dios, el grande, el poderoso, y el temible Dios, que guardas el pacto y la misericordia, no parezca poco ante ti todo el sufrimiento que ha venido sobre nosotros, sobre nuestros reyes, sobre nuestros príncipes, sobre nuestros sacerdotes, sobre nuestros profetas, sobre nuestros padres, y sobre todo tu pueblo, desde los días de los reyes de Asiria hasta este día. | Sin embargo, tú eres justo en todo lo que ha venido sobre nosotros; porque tú has hecho lo correcto, pero nosotros hemos actuado malvadamente: | Ni nuestros reyes, ni nuestros príncipes, ni nuestros sacerdotes, ni nuestros padres, han guardado tu ley, ni han escuchado tus mandamientos y tus testimonios, con los cuales testificaste contra ellos. | Porque no te han servido en su reino, y en tu gran bondad que les diste, y en la tierra grande y fértil que pusiste delante de ellos, ni se apartaron de sus malas obras. | He aquí, somos siervos hoy, y en la tierra que diste a nuestros padres para comer su fruto y su bien, he aquí, somos siervos en ella: | Y produce mucho aumento para los reyes que has puesto sobre nosotros por causa de nuestros pecados: también tienen dominio sobre nuestros cuerpos, y sobre nuestro ganado, a su antojo, y estamos en gran angustia. | Y a causa de todo esto hacemos un pacto seguro, y lo escribimos; y nuestros príncipes, levitas, y sacerdotes, lo sellan.",

      "ChapterText": "El día veinticuatro del mismo mes, los israelitas se reunieron, ayunando y vistiendo cilicio y con polvo sobre sus cabezas. | Los de ascendencia israelita se habían separado de todos los extranjeros. Se pusieron de pie en sus lugares y confesaron sus pecados y la maldad de sus padres. | Se quedaron donde estaban y leyeron del Libro de la Ley del SEÑOR su Dios durante un cuarto del día, y pasaron otro cuarto en confesión y adorando al SEÑOR su Dios. | De pie en las escaleras estaban los levitas-Jesúa, Bani, Cadmiel, Sebanías, Buni, Serebías, Bani y Quenaní-quienes clamaron con fuertes voces al SEÑOR su Dios. | Y los levitas-Jesúa, Cadmiel, Bani, Hasabneías, Serebías, Hodías, Sebanías y Petahías-dijeron: \"Levántense y alaben al SEÑOR su Dios, que es de eternidad a eternidad. Bendito sea tu glorioso nombre, y que sea exaltado sobre toda bendición y alabanza. | Solo tú eres el SEÑOR. Tú hiciste los cielos, incluso los cielos más altos, y todo su ejército estelar, la tierra y todo lo que hay en ella, los mares y todo lo que hay en ellos. Tú das vida a todo, y las multitudes del cielo te adoran. | \"Tú eres el SEÑOR Dios, que eligió a Abram y lo sacó de Ur de los caldeos y le puso por nombre Abraham. | Encontraste su corazón fiel a ti, e hiciste un pacto con él para dar a sus descendientes la tierra de los cananeos, hititas, amorreos, ferezeos, jebuseos y gergeseos. Has cumplido tu promesa porque eres justo. | \"Viste el sufrimiento de nuestros antepasados en Egipto; escuchaste su clamor en el Mar Rojo. | Enviaste señales y maravillas milagrosas contra el faraón, contra todos sus oficiales y todo el pueblo de su tierra, porque sabías cuán arrogantemente los egipcios los trataron. Te hiciste un nombre, que permanece hasta hoy. | Dividiste el mar delante de ellos, para que pasaran por él en tierra seca, pero arrojaste a sus perseguidores a las profundidades, como una piedra en aguas poderosas. | De día los guiaste con una columna de nube, y de noche con una columna de fuego para darles luz en el camino que debían tomar. | \"Descendiste al monte Sinaí; les hablaste desde el cielo. Les diste regulaciones y leyes que son justas y correctas, y decretos y mandamientos que son buenos. | Les diste a conocer tu santo sábado y les diste mandamientos, decretos y leyes a través de tu siervo Moisés. | En su hambre les diste pan del cielo y en su sed les sacaste agua de la roca; les dijiste que entraran y tomaran posesión de la tierra que habías jurado con mano levantada darles. | \"Pero ellos, nuestros antepasados, se volvieron arrogantes y tercos, y no obedecieron tus mandamientos. | Se negaron a escuchar y no recordaron los milagros que realizaste entre ellos. Se volvieron tercos y en su rebelión nombraron un líder para regresar a su esclavitud. Pero tú eres un Dios perdonador, clemente y compasivo, lento para la ira y abundante en amor. Por lo tanto, no los abandonaste, | incluso cuando se hicieron una imagen de un becerro y dijeron: 'Este es tu dios, que te sacó de Egipto', o cuando cometieron horribles blasfemias. | \"Por tu gran compasión no los abandonaste en el desierto. De día la columna de nube no dejó de guiarlos en su camino, ni la columna de fuego de noche para iluminar el camino que debían tomar. | Les diste tu buen Espíritu para instruirlos. No les negaste tu maná de sus bocas, y les diste agua para su sed. | Durante cuarenta años los sustentaste en el desierto; no les faltó nada, sus ropas no se desgastaron ni sus pies se hincharon. | \"Les diste reinos y naciones, asignándoles incluso las fronteras más remotas. Tomaron el país de Sehón, rey de Hesbón, y el país de Og, rey de Basán. | Hiciste a sus hijos tan numerosos como las estrellas del cielo, y los llevaste a la tierra que dijiste a sus padres que entraran y poseyeran. | Sus hijos entraron y tomaron posesión de la tierra. Subyugaste ante ellos a los cananeos, que vivían en la tierra; entregaste a los cananeos en sus manos, junto con sus reyes y los pueblos de la tierra, para que hicieran con ellos lo que quisieran. | Capturaron ciudades fortificadas y tierras fértiles; tomaron posesión de casas llenas de todo tipo de cosas buenas, pozos ya cavados, viñedos, olivares y árboles frutales en abundancia. Comieron hasta saciarse y fueron bien alimentados; se deleitaron en tu gran bondad. | \"Pero fueron desobedientes y se rebelaron contra ti; pusieron tu ley detrás de sus espaldas. Mataron a tus profetas, que los habían amonestado para que volvieran a ti; cometieron horribles blasfemias. | Así que los entregaste a sus enemigos, que los oprimieron. Pero cuando fueron oprimidos clamaron a ti. Desde el cielo los escuchaste, y en tu gran compasión les diste libertadores, que los rescataron de la mano de sus enemigos. | \"Pero tan pronto como estuvieron en descanso, volvieron a hacer lo malo ante tus ojos. Entonces los abandonaste en manos de sus enemigos para que los gobernaran. Y cuando clamaron a ti de nuevo, los escuchaste desde el cielo, y en tu compasión los liberaste una y otra vez. | \"Les advertiste que volvieran a tu ley, pero se volvieron arrogantes y desobedecieron tus mandamientos. Pecaron contra tus ordenanzas, por las cuales un hombre vivirá si las obedece. Obstinadamente te dieron la espalda, se volvieron tercos y se negaron a escuchar. | Durante muchos años fuiste paciente con ellos. Por tu Espíritu los amonestaste a través de tus profetas. Sin embargo, no prestaron atención, así que los entregaste a los pueblos vecinos. | Pero en tu gran misericordia no los exterminaste ni los abandonaste, porque eres un Dios clemente y misericordioso. | \"Ahora, por lo tanto, oh nuestro Dios, el gran, poderoso y temible Dios, que guarda su pacto de amor, no dejes que toda esta dificultad parezca insignificante a tus ojos-la dificultad que ha venido sobre nosotros, sobre nuestros reyes y líderes, sobre nuestros sacerdotes y profetas, sobre nuestros padres y todo tu pueblo, desde los días de los reyes de Asiria hasta hoy. | En todo lo que nos ha sucedido, has sido justo; has actuado fielmente, mientras nosotros hicimos lo malo. | Nuestros reyes, nuestros líderes, nuestros sacerdotes y nuestros padres no siguieron tu ley; no prestaron atención a tus mandamientos ni a las advertencias que les diste. | Incluso mientras estaban en su reino, disfrutando de tu gran bondad hacia ellos en la tierra espaciosa y fértil que les diste, no te sirvieron ni se apartaron de sus malos caminos. | \"Pero mira, hoy somos esclavos, esclavos en la tierra que diste a nuestros antepasados para que comieran su fruto y las otras cosas buenas que produce. | Debido a nuestros pecados, su abundante cosecha va a los reyes que has puesto sobre nosotros. Ellos gobiernan sobre nuestros cuerpos y nuestro ganado como les place. Estamos en gran angustia. | \"En vista de todo esto, estamos haciendo un acuerdo vinculante, poniéndolo por escrito, y nuestros líderes, nuestros levitas y nuestros sacerdotes están poniendo sus sellos en él.\"",

      "ChapterText": "9\nThe People Confess Their Sin|Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the sons of Israel assembled with fasting, in sackcloth and with dirt upon them.|The descendants of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and they stood and confessed their sins and the wrongdoings of their fathers.|While they stood in their place, they read from the Book of the Law of the Lord their God for a fourth of the day; and for another fourth they confessed and worshiped the Lord their God.|Now on the Levites' platform stood Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and they cried out with a loud voice to the Lord their God.|Then the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah said, \"Arise, bless the Lord your God forever and ever!\n May Your glorious name be blessed\n And exalted above all blessing and praise!|\"You alone are the Lord.\n You have made the heavens,\n The heaven of heavens with all their lights,\n The earth and everything that is on it,\n The seas and everything that is in them.\n You give life to all of them,\n And the heavenly lights bow down before You.|\"You are the Lord God,\n Who chose Abram\n And brought him out from Ur of the Chaldees,\n And gave him the name Abraham.|\"You found his heart faithful before You,\n And made a covenant with him\n To give him the land of the Canaanite,\n Of the Hittite and the Amorite,\n Of the Perizzite, the Jebusite, and the Girgashite-\n To give it to his descendants.\n And You have fulfilled Your promise,\n Because You are righteous.|\"You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt,\n And heard their cry by the Red Sea.|\"Then You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh,\n Against all his servants and all the people of his land;\n For You knew that they acted arrogantly toward them,\n And You made a name for Yourself as it is this day.|\"You divided the sea before them,\n So they passed through the midst of the sea on dry ground;\n And You hurled their pursuers into the depths,\n Like a stone into raging waters.|\"And with a pillar of cloud You led them by day,\n And with a pillar of fire by night\n To light for them the way\n In which they were to go.|\"Then You came down on Mount Sinai,\n And spoke with them from heaven;\n You gave them just ordinances and true laws,\n Good statutes and commandments.|\"So You made known to them Your holy Sabbath,\n And gave them commandments, statutes, and law,\n Through Your servant Moses.|\"You provided bread from heaven for them for their hunger,\n You brought out water from a rock for them for their thirst,\n And You told them to enter in order to take possession of\n The land which You swore to give them.|\"But they, our fathers, acted arrogantly;\n They became stubborn and would not listen to Your commandments.|\"They refused to listen,\n And did not remember Your wondrous deeds which You performed among them;\n So they became stubborn and appointed a leader to return to their slavery in Egypt.\n But You are a God of forgiveness,\n Gracious and compassionate,\n Slow to anger and abounding in mercy;\n And You did not abandon them.|\"Even when they made for themselves\n A calf of cast metal\n And said, 'This is your god\n Who brought you up from Egypt,'\n And committed great blasphemies,|You, in Your great compassion,\n Did not abandon them in the wilderness;\n The pillar of cloud did not leave them by day,\n To guide them on their way,\n Nor the pillar of fire by night, to light for them the way in which they were to go.|\"Instead, You gave Your good Spirit to instruct them,\n You did not withhold Your manna from their mouth,\n And You gave them water for their thirst.|\"Indeed, for forty years You provided for them in the wilderness and they were not lacking;\n Their clothes did not wear out, nor did their feet swell up.|\"You also gave them kingdoms and peoples,\n And allotted them to them as a boundary.\n They took possession of the land of Sihon the king of Heshbon\n And the land of Og the king of Bashan.|\"You made their sons as numerous as the stars of heaven,\n And You brought them into the land\n Which You had told their fathers to enter and possess.|\"So their sons entered and took possession of the land.\n And You subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites,\n And You handed them over to them, with their kings and the peoples of the land,\n To do with them as they desired.|\"They captured fortified cities and a fertile land.\n They took possession of houses full of every good thing,\n Carved out cisterns, vineyards, olive groves,\n Fruit trees in abundance.\n So they ate, were filled and put on fat,\n And lived luxuriously in Your great goodness.|\"But they became rebellious and revolted against You,\n And threw Your Law behind their backs\n And killed Your prophets who had admonished them\n In order to bring them back to You,\n And they committed great blasphemies.|\"Therefore You handed them over to their enemies who oppressed them,\n But when they cried out to You in the time of their distress,\n You heard from heaven, and according to Your great compassion\n You gave them people who saved them from the hand of their enemies.|\"But as soon as they had rest, they did evil again before You;\n Therefore You abandoned them to the hand of their enemies, so that they ruled over them.\n When they cried out again to You, You heard from heaven,\n And many times You rescued them according to Your compassion,|And admonished them in order to turn them back to Your Law.\n Yet they acted arrogantly and did not listen to Your commandments but sinned against Your ordinances,\n Which, if a person follows them, then he will live by them.\n And they turned a stubborn shoulder and stiffened their neck, and would not listen.|\"However, You remained patient with them for many years,\n And admonished them by Your Spirit through Your prophets,\n Yet they would not listen.\n Therefore You handed them over to the peoples of the lands.|\"Nevertheless, in Your great compassion You did not make an end of them or abandon them,\n For You are a gracious and compassionate God.|\"Now then, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps His covenant and faithfulness,\n Do not let all the hardship seem insignificant before You,\n Which has happened to us, our kings, our leaders, our priests, our prophets, our fathers, and to all Your people,\n From the days of the kings of Assyria to this day.|\"However, You are righteous in everything that has happened to us;\n For You have dealt faithfully, but we have acted wickedly.|\"For our kings, our leaders, our priests, and our fathers have not kept Your Law\n Or paid attention to Your commandments and Your admonitions with which You have admonished them.|\"But they, in their own kingdom,\n With Your great goodness which You gave them,\n With the broad and rich land which You placed before them,\n Did not serve You or turn from their evil deeds.|\"Behold, we are slaves today,\n And as for the land which You gave to our fathers to eat its fruit and its bounty,\n Behold, we are slaves on it.|\"And its abundant produce is for the kings\n Whom You have set over us because of our sins;\n They also rule over our bodies\n And over our cattle as they please,\n So we are in great distress.\nA Covenant Results|\"Now because of all this\n We are making an agreement in writing;\n And on the sealed document are the names of our leaders, our Levites, and our priests.\"",

Y has cumplido lo que prometiste, porque siempre eres fiel a tu palabra.|\"Viste la miseria de nuestros antepasados en Egipto, y escuchaste sus clamores junto al Mar Rojo.|Mostraste señales y maravillas milagrosas contra el faraón, sus oficiales y todo su pueblo, porque sabías cuán arrogantemente trataban a nuestros antepasados. Tienes una reputación gloriosa que nunca ha sido olvidada.|¡Dividiste el mar para que tu pueblo pudiera pasar por tierra seca! Y luego lanzaste a sus enemigos a las profundidades del mar. Se hundieron como piedras bajo las poderosas aguas.|Guiaste a nuestros antepasados con una columna de nube durante el día y una columna de fuego por la noche para que pudieran encontrar su camino.|\"Descendiste al monte Sinaí y les hablaste desde el cielo. Les diste regulaciones e instrucciones justas, y decretos y mandamientos buenos.|Les instruiste sobre tu santo sábado. Y les ordenaste, a través de Moisés tu siervo, que obedecieran todos tus mandamientos, decretos e instrucciones.|\"Les diste pan del cielo cuando tenían hambre y agua de la roca cuando tenían sed. Les ordenaste que fueran y tomaran posesión de la tierra que habías jurado darles.|\"Pero nuestros antepasados fueron orgullosos y tercos, y no prestaron atención a tus mandamientos.|Se negaron a obedecer y no recordaron los milagros que habías hecho por ellos. En cambio, se volvieron tercos y nombraron un líder para llevarlos de regreso a su esclavitud en Egipto. Pero tú eres un Dios de perdón, lleno de gracia y misericordia, lento para enojarte y rico en amor inagotable. No los abandonaste,|incluso cuando hicieron un ídolo con forma de becerro y dijeron: '¡Este es tu dios que te sacó de Egipto!'

La columna de nube aún los guiaba durante el día, y la columna de fuego les mostraba el camino durante la noche.|Enviaste tu buen Espíritu para instruirlos, y no dejaste de darles maná del cielo ni agua para su sed.|Durante cuarenta años los sustentaste en el desierto, y no les faltó nada. ¡Sus ropas no se desgastaron y sus pies no se hincharon!|\"Luego ayudaste a nuestros antepasados a conquistar reinos y naciones, y colocaste a tu pueblo en cada rincón de la tierra. Tomaron la tierra del rey Sehón de Hesbón y la tierra del rey Og de Basán.|Hiciste que sus descendientes fueran tan numerosos como las estrellas del cielo y los llevaste a la tierra que habías prometido a sus antepasados.|\"Entraron y tomaron posesión de la tierra.

Tomaron casas llenas de cosas buenas, con cisternas ya cavadas y viñedos y olivares y árboles frutales en abundancia. Así que comieron hasta saciarse y engordaron y disfrutaron de todas tus bendiciones.|\"Pero a pesar de todo esto, fueron desobedientes y se rebelaron contra ti. Dieron la espalda a tu Ley, mataron a tus profetas que les advertían que regresaran a ti, y cometieron terribles blasfemias.|Así que los entregaste a sus enemigos, que los hicieron sufrir. Pero en su tiempo de angustia clamaron a ti, y los escuchaste desde el cielo. En tu gran misericordia, les enviaste libertadores que los rescataron de sus enemigos.|\"Pero tan pronto como estaban en paz, tu pueblo nuevamente cometió maldad ante tus ojos, y una vez más dejaste que sus enemigos los conquistaran. Sin embargo, cada vez que tu pueblo se volvía y clamaba a ti nuevamente por ayuda, los escuchabas una vez más desde el cielo. ¡En tu maravillosa misericordia, los rescataste muchas veces!|\"Les advertiste que regresaran a tu Ley, pero se volvieron orgullosos y obstinados y desobedecieron tus mandamientos. No siguieron tus regulaciones, por las cuales la gente encontrará vida si solo obedecen. Tercamente te dieron la espalda y se negaron a escuchar.|En tu amor, fuiste paciente con ellos durante muchos años. Enviaste tu Espíritu, que les advirtió a través de los profetas. ¡Pero aún así no escucharon! Así que una vez más permitiste que los pueblos de la tierra los conquistaran.|Pero en tu gran misericordia, no los destruiste completamente ni los abandonaste para siempre. ¡Qué Dios tan bondadoso y misericordioso eres!|\"Y ahora, nuestro Dios, el gran y poderoso y asombroso Dios, que guarda su pacto de amor inagotable, no dejes que todas las dificultades que hemos sufrido te parezcan insignificantes. Grandes problemas han venido sobre nosotros y sobre nuestros reyes y líderes y sacerdotes y profetas y antepasados-todo tu pueblo-desde los días en que los reyes de Asiria triunfaron sobre nosotros hasta ahora.|Cada vez que nos castigaste fuiste justo. Hemos pecado gravemente, y nos diste solo lo que merecíamos.|Nuestros reyes, líderes, sacerdotes y antepasados no obedecieron tu Ley ni escucharon las advertencias en tus mandamientos y leyes.|Incluso mientras tenían su propio reino, no te sirvieron, aunque derramaste tu bondad sobre ellos. Les diste una tierra grande y fértil, pero se negaron a apartarse de su maldad.|\"Así que ahora hoy somos esclavos en la tierra de abundancia que diste a nuestros antepasados para su disfrute. ¡Somos esclavos aquí en esta buena tierra.|La abundante producción de esta tierra se acumula en manos de los reyes que has puesto sobre nosotros debido a nuestros pecados.

Todo ser viviente en el cielo te adora.|'Tú eres el Señor Dios. Elegiste a Abram. Lo sacaste de Ur en la tierra de Babilonia. Lo nombraste Abraham.|Sabías que su corazón era fiel a ti. Y hiciste un pacto con él. Prometiste dar a sus hijos después de él una tierra propia. Era la tierra de los cananeos, hititas y amorreos. También vivían allí los ferezeos, jebuseos y gergeseos. Has cumplido tu promesa. Eso es porque siempre haces lo que es justo y correcto.|'Viste cómo nuestro pueblo de antaño sufrió en Egipto. Los escuchaste clamar a ti en el Mar Rojo.|Enviaste señales y maravillas contra el faraón. Enviaste plagas a todos sus oficiales. De hecho, las enviaste a todo el pueblo de Egipto. Sabías cómo trataban a nuestro pueblo. Los menospreciaban. Pero te hiciste un nombre. Ese nombre permanece hasta el día de hoy.|Partiste las aguas del Mar Rojo para los israelitas. Pasaron por él en tierra seca. Pero arrojaste al mar a los que los perseguían. Se hundieron como una piedra en las aguas poderosas.|De día guiaste a los israelitas con una columna de nube. De noche los guiaste con una columna de fuego. Les daba luz para mostrarles el camino que querías que siguieran.|'Descendiste al monte Sinaí. Desde el cielo hablaste a nuestro pueblo. Les diste reglas y leyes. Esas leyes son justas y correctas. Les diste órdenes y mandamientos que son buenos.|Les enseñaste sobre tu santo día de reposo. Les diste mandamientos, órdenes y leyes. Lo hiciste a través de tu siervo Moisés.|Cuando el pueblo tenía hambre, les diste pan del cielo. Cuando tenían sed, les sacaste agua de una roca. Les dijiste que entraran en la tierra de Canaán. Les dijiste que la tomaran como suya. Era la tierra que habías prometido darles.|'Pero nuestro pueblo antes de nosotros se volvió orgulloso y terco. No obedecieron tus mandamientos.|Se negaron a escucharte. Olvidaron los milagros que habías hecho entre ellos. Así que se volvieron tercos. Cuando se negaron a obedecerte, se nombraron un líder para sí mismos. Querían volver a ser esclavos en Egipto. Pero tú eres un Dios que perdona. Eres misericordioso. Eres tierno y amable. Eres lento para enojarte. Estás lleno de amor. Así que no los abandonaste.|Se hicieron para sí mismos una estatua de metal de un dios que parecía un becerro. Se dijeron unos a otros: \"Aquí está tu dios. Él te sacó de Egipto\". Y hicieron cosas malas que te deshonraron. Pero aún así no los abandonaste.|'Porque los amabas tanto, no los dejaste en el desierto. Durante el día la columna de nube no dejó de guiarlos en su camino. De noche la columna de fuego no dejó de brillar en el camino que querías que siguieran.|Les diste tu buen Espíritu para enseñarles. No les negaste tu maná de sus bocas. Y les diste agua cuando tenían sed.|Durante 40 años los cuidaste bien en el desierto. Tenían todo lo que necesitaban. Su ropa no se desgastó. Y sus pies no se hincharon.|'Les diste reinos y naciones. Incluso les diste tierras lejanas. Tomaron el país de Sehón. Él era el rey de Hesbón. También tomaron el país de Og. Él era el rey de Basán.|Les diste tantos hijos como hay estrellas en el cielo. Les dijiste a sus padres que entraran en la tierra. Les dijiste que la tomaran. Y llevaste a sus hijos a ella.|Sus hijos entraron en la tierra. La tomaron como suya. Pusiste a los cananeos bajo el control de Israel. Los cananeos vivían en la tierra. Pero los entregaste a Israel. También entregaste a sus reyes y a las otras naciones en la tierra a Israel. Permitiste que Israel los tratara como quisieran.|Tu pueblo capturó ciudades que tenían altos muros a su alrededor. También tomaron la rica tierra de Canaán. Tomaron casas llenas de todo tipo de cosas buenas. Tomaron pozos que ya habían sido cavados. Tomaron muchos viñedos, olivares y árboles frutales. Comieron hasta quedar muy llenos y satisfechos. Estaban llenos de alegría porque fuiste tan bueno con ellos.|'Pero no te obedecieron. En cambio, se volvieron contra ti. Dieron la espalda a tu ley. Mataron a tus profetas. Los profetas les habían advertido que regresaran a ti. Pero hicieron cosas muy malas que te deshonraron.|Así que los entregaste a sus enemigos, que los trataron mal. Entonces clamaron a ti. Desde el cielo los escuchaste. Los amabas mucho. Así que enviaste líderes para ayudarlos. Los líderes los salvaron del poder de sus enemigos.|'Entonces el pueblo estaba disfrutando de paz y descanso de nuevo. Fue entonces cuando hicieron lo que no querías que hicieran. Entonces los entregaste a sus enemigos. Así que sus enemigos los gobernaron. Cuando clamaron a ti de nuevo, los escuchaste desde el cielo. Los amabas mucho. Así que los salvaste una y otra vez.|'Les advertiste para que obedecieran tu ley de nuevo. Pero se volvieron orgullosos. No obedecieron tus mandamientos. Pecaron contra tus reglas. Dijiste: \"Cualquiera que obedezca mis reglas vivirá por ellas\". Pero al pueblo no le importó eso. Te dieron la espalda. Se volvieron muy tercos. Se negaron a escucharte.|Durante muchos años los soportaste. Por tu Espíritu les advertiste a través de tus profetas. A pesar de eso, no prestaron atención. Así que los entregaste a las naciones que estaban a su alrededor.|Pero los amabas mucho. Así que no los exterminaste. No los abandonaste. Eso es porque eres un Dios misericordioso. Eres tierno y amable.|'Nuestro Dios, tú eres el gran Dios. Eres poderoso y maravilloso. Mantienes el pacto que hiciste con nosotros. Nos muestras tu amor. Así que no dejes que todo nuestro sufrimiento parezca una cosa pequeña para ti. Hemos sufrido mucho. También lo han hecho nuestros reyes y líderes. También lo han hecho nuestros sacerdotes y profetas. Nuestro pueblo que vivió hace mucho tiempo también sufrió. Y todo tu pueblo está sufriendo ahora mismo. De hecho, hemos estado sufriendo desde la época de los reyes de Asiria hasta hoy.|A pesar de todo lo que nos ha pasado, has sido justo. Has sido fiel en lo que has hecho. Pero nosotros hicimos lo que era malo.|Nuestros reyes y líderes no siguieron tu ley. Nuestros sacerdotes y nuestro pueblo antes de nosotros tampoco la siguieron. No prestaron atención a tus mandamientos ni a las reglas que les advertiste que guardaran.|No te sirvieron. No se apartaron de sus malos caminos. No te obedecieron ni siquiera cuando tenían un reino. Fuiste muy bueno con ellos. Y lo disfrutaron. Les diste una tierra rica. Tenía mucho espacio en ella. Pero aún así no te sirvieron.|'Ahora míranos. Somos esclavos hoy. Somos esclavos en la tierra que diste a nuestro pueblo hace mucho tiempo. Se la diste para que pudieran comer su fruto y las otras cosas buenas que produce.|Pero hemos pecado contra ti. Así que su gran cosecha va a los reyes de Persia. Los has puesto sobre nosotros. Gobiernan sobre nuestros cuerpos y ganado como les place. Y estamos sufriendo terriblemente. El pueblo acuerda obedecer la ley de Dios|'Así que estamos haciendo un acuerdo firme. Lo estamos escribiendo. Nuestros líderes están poniendo sus marcas oficiales en él. Y también lo están haciendo nuestros levitas y sacerdotes.'",

      "ChapterText": "9\nEl Pueblo Confiesa Sus Pecados|Ahora, en el día veinticuatro de este mes, los hijos de Israel se reunieron con ayuno, vestidos de cilicio y con polvo sobre sus cabezas.|Entonces los de linaje israelita se separaron de todos los extranjeros; y se pusieron de pie y confesaron sus pecados y las iniquidades de sus padres.|Y se levantaron en su lugar y leyeron del Libro de la Ley del Señor su Dios durante una cuarta parte del día; y durante otra cuarta parte confesaron y adoraron al Señor su Dios.|Entonces Jesúa, Bani, Cadmiel, Sebanías, Buni, Serebías, Bani y Quenaní se pusieron de pie en las gradas de los levitas y clamaron en alta voz al Señor su Dios.|Y los levitas, Jesúa, Cadmiel, Bani, Hasabnías, Serebías, Hodías, Sebanías y Petahías, dijeron:\n \"Levántense y bendigan al Señor su Dios\n Por los siglos de los siglos.\n \"Bendito sea Tu glorioso nombre,\n Que está exaltado sobre toda bendición y alabanza.|Solo Tú eres el Señor;\n Tú hiciste el cielo,\n El cielo de los cielos, con todo su ejército,\n La tierra y todo lo que hay en ella,\n Los mares y todo lo que hay en ellos,\n Y Tú los preservas a todos.\n El ejército del cielo te adora.|\"Tú eres el Señor Dios,\n Que escogiste a Abram,\n Y lo sacaste de Ur de los caldeos,\n Y le diste el nombre de Abraham;|Encontraste su corazón fiel delante de Ti,\n E hiciste un pacto con él\n Para darle la tierra de los cananeos,\n Los hititas, los amorreos,\n Los ferezeos, los jebuseos,\n Y los gergeseos,\n Para darla a sus descendientes.\n Tú has cumplido Tus palabras,\n Porque Tú eres justo.|\"Viste la aflicción de nuestros padres en Egipto,\n Y escuchaste su clamor junto al Mar Rojo.|Mostraste señales y maravillas contra Faraón,\n Contra todos sus siervos,\n Y contra todo el pueblo de su tierra.\n Porque sabías que actuaron con soberbia contra ellos.\n Así hiciste un nombre para Ti, como es hasta hoy.|Y dividiste el mar delante de ellos,\n Para que pasaran por en medio del mar en tierra seca;\n Y a sus perseguidores los arrojaste a lo profundo,\n Como una piedra en las aguas poderosas.|Además los guiaste de día con una columna de nube,\n Y de noche con una columna de fuego,\n Para darles luz en el camino\n Por el que debían ir.|\"También descendiste sobre el monte Sinaí,\n Y hablaste con ellos desde el cielo,\n Y les diste justas ordenanzas y leyes verdaderas,\n Buenos estatutos y mandamientos.|Les diste a conocer Tu santo sábado,\n Y les ordenaste preceptos, estatutos y leyes,\n Por mano de Moisés Tu siervo.|Les diste pan del cielo para su hambre,\n Y sacaste agua de la roca para su sed,\n Y les dijiste que entraran a poseer la tierra\n Que habías jurado darles.|\"Pero ellos y nuestros padres actuaron con soberbia,\n Endurecieron su cerviz,\n Y no escucharon Tus mandamientos.|Rehusaron obedecer,\n Y no se acordaron de Tus maravillas\n Que hiciste entre ellos.\n Sino que endurecieron su cerviz,\n Y en su rebelión\n Nombraron un líder\n Para regresar a su esclavitud.\n Pero Tú eres Dios,\n Pronto para perdonar,\n Gracioso y misericordioso,\n Lento para la ira,\n Abundante en bondad,\n Y no los abandonaste.|\"Aun cuando hicieron para sí un becerro de fundición,\n Y dijeron: 'Este es tu dios\n Que te sacó de Egipto,'\n Y cometieron grandes provocaciones,|Sin embargo, en Tus muchas misericordias\n No los abandonaste en el desierto.\n La columna de nube no se apartó de ellos de día,\n Para guiarlos en el camino;\n Ni la columna de fuego de noche,\n Para mostrarles luz,\n Y el camino que debían seguir.|También les diste Tu buen Espíritu para instruirlos,\n Y no les negaste Tu maná de su boca,\n Y les diste agua para su sed.|Cuarenta años los sustentaste en el desierto;\n No les faltó nada;\n Sus vestidos no se envejecieron\n Y sus pies no se hincharon.|\"Además les diste reinos y naciones,\n Y los dividiste en distritos.\n Así tomaron posesión de la tierra de Sehón,\n La tierra del rey de Hesbón,\n Y la tierra de Og rey de Basán.|También multiplicaste sus hijos como las estrellas del cielo,\n Y los llevaste a la tierra\n Que habías dicho a sus padres\n Que entraran a poseer.|Así el pueblo entró\n Y poseyó la tierra;\n Subyugaste delante de ellos a los habitantes de la tierra,\n Los cananeos,\n Y los entregaste en sus manos,\n Con sus reyes\n Y el pueblo de la tierra,\n Para que hicieran con ellos lo que quisieran.|Y tomaron ciudades fortificadas y una tierra rica,\n Y poseyeron casas llenas de toda clase de bienes,\n Cisternas ya cavadas, viñedos, olivares,\n Y árboles frutales en abundancia.\n Así comieron y se saciaron y engordaron,\n Y se deleitaron en Tu gran bondad.|\"Sin embargo, fueron desobedientes\n Y se rebelaron contra Ti,\n Arrojaron Tu ley detrás de sus espaldas\n Y mataron a Tus profetas, que testificaron contra ellos\n Para volverlos a Ti;\n Y cometieron grandes provocaciones.|Por lo tanto, los entregaste en manos de sus enemigos,\n Que los oprimieron;\n Y en el tiempo de su angustia,\n Cuando clamaron a Ti,\n Escuchaste desde el cielo;\n Y conforme a Tus abundantes misericordias\n Les diste libertadores que los salvaron\n De la mano de sus enemigos.|\"Pero después de que tuvieron descanso,\n Volvieron a hacer lo malo delante de Ti.\n Por lo tanto, los dejaste en manos de sus enemigos,\n Para que tuvieran dominio sobre ellos;\n Sin embargo, cuando regresaron y clamaron a Ti,\n Escuchaste desde el cielo;\n Y muchas veces los libraste conforme a Tus misericordias,|Y testificaste contra ellos,\n Para que los trajeras de vuelta a Tu ley.\n Sin embargo, actuaron con soberbia,\n Y no escucharon Tus mandamientos,\n Sino que pecaron contra Tus juicios,\n 'Que si un hombre los hace, vivirá por ellos.'\n Y encogieron sus hombros,\n Endurecieron su cerviz,\n Y no quisieron escuchar.|Sin embargo, por muchos años Tuviste paciencia con ellos,\n Y testificaste contra ellos por Tu Espíritu en Tus profetas.\n Sin embargo, no quisieron escuchar;\n Por lo tanto, los entregaste en manos de los pueblos de las tierras.|No obstante, en Tu gran misericordia\n No los consumiste por completo ni los abandonaste;\n Porque Tú eres Dios, clemente y misericordioso.|\"Ahora pues, nuestro Dios,\n El grande, el poderoso y temible Dios,\n Que guarda el pacto y la misericordia:\n No dejes que toda la aflicción parezca pequeña ante Ti\n Que ha venido sobre nosotros,\n Nuestros reyes y nuestros príncipes,\n Nuestros sacerdotes y nuestros profetas,\n Nuestros padres y sobre todo Tu pueblo,\n Desde los días de los reyes de Asiria hasta este día.|Sin embargo, Tú eres justo en todo lo que nos ha sobrevenido;\n Porque Tú has actuado fielmente,\n Pero nosotros hemos hecho lo malo.|Ni nuestros reyes ni nuestros príncipes,\n Nuestros sacerdotes ni nuestros padres,\n Han guardado Tu ley,\n Ni escuchado Tus mandamientos y Tus testimonios,\n Con los cuales testificaste contra ellos.|Porque no Te han servido en su reino,\n Ni en las muchas cosas buenas que les diste,\n Ni en la tierra grande y rica que pusiste delante de ellos;\n Ni se apartaron de sus malas obras.|\"¡Aquí estamos, siervos hoy!\n Y la tierra que diste a nuestros padres,\n Para comer su fruto y su abundancia,\n ¡Aquí estamos, siervos en ella!|Y produce mucho aumento para los reyes\n Que has puesto sobre nosotros,\n A causa de nuestros pecados;\n También tienen dominio sobre nuestros cuerpos y nuestro ganado\n A su placer;\n Y estamos en gran angustia.|\"Y a causa de todo esto,\n Hacemos un pacto seguro y lo escribimos;\n Nuestros líderes, nuestros levitas y nuestros sacerdotes lo sellan.\"",

Luego, durante tres horas más, confesaron sus pecados y adoraron al Señor su Dios.|Los levitas-Jesúa, Bani, Cadmiel, Sebanías, Buni, Serebías, Bani y Quenani-se pusieron de pie en la escalera de los levitas y clamaron al Señor su Dios con fuertes voces.|Entonces los líderes de los levitas-Jesúa, Cadmiel, Bani, Hasabneías, Serebías, Hodías, Sebanías y Petahías-llamaron al pueblo: \"¡Levántense y alaben al Señor su Dios, porque vive de eternidad en eternidad!\" Luego oraron:\n\n\"¡Que sea alabado tu glorioso nombre! ¡Que sea exaltado por encima de toda bendición y alabanza!|\"Solo tú eres el Señor.

Tú los preservas a todos, y los ángeles del cielo te adoran.|\"Tú eres el Señor Dios, que eligió a Abram y lo sacó de Ur de los caldeos y le cambió el nombre a Abraham.|Cuando demostró ser fiel, hiciste un pacto con él para darle a él y a sus descendientes la tierra de los cananeos, hititas, amorreos, ferezeos, jebuseos y gergeseos. Y has cumplido lo que prometiste, porque siempre eres fiel a tu palabra.|\"Viste la miseria de nuestros antepasados en Egipto, y escuchaste sus clamores junto al Mar Rojo.|Mostraste señales y maravillas milagrosas contra el faraón, sus oficiales y todo su pueblo, porque sabías cuán arrogantemente trataban a nuestros antepasados. Tienes una reputación gloriosa que nunca ha sido olvidada.|Dividiste el mar para tu pueblo para que pudieran caminar por tierra seca. ¡Y luego arrojaste a sus enemigos a las profundidades del mar! Se hundieron como piedras bajo las poderosas aguas.|Guiaste a nuestros antepasados con una columna de nube durante el día y una columna de fuego por la noche para que pudieran encontrar su camino.|\"Descendiste en el monte Sinaí y les hablaste desde el cielo. Les diste regulaciones e instrucciones que eran justas, y decretos y mandamientos que eran buenos.|Les instruiste sobre tu santo sábado. Y les ordenaste, a través de Moisés tu siervo, que obedecieran todos tus mandamientos, decretos e instrucciones.|\"Les diste pan del cielo cuando tenían hambre y agua de la roca cuando tenían sed. Les ordenaste que fueran y tomaran posesión de la tierra que habías jurado darles.|\"Pero nuestros antepasados fueron orgullosos y tercos, y no prestaron atención a tus mandamientos.|Se negaron a obedecer y no recordaron los milagros que habías hecho por ellos. En cambio, se volvieron tercos y nombraron un líder para llevarlos de regreso a su esclavitud en Egipto. Pero tú eres un Dios de perdón, lleno de gracia y misericordia, lento para enojarte y rico en amor inagotable. No los abandonaste,|incluso cuando hicieron un ídolo con forma de becerro y dijeron: '¡Este es tu dios que te sacó de Egipto!' Cometieron terribles blasfemias.|\"Pero en tu gran misericordia no los abandonaste a morir en el desierto. La columna de nube todavía los guiaba durante el día, y la columna de fuego les mostraba el camino durante la noche.|Enviaste tu buen Espíritu para instruirlos, y no dejaste de darles maná del cielo ni agua para su sed.|Durante cuarenta años los sustentaste en el desierto, y no les faltó nada. ¡Sus ropas no se desgastaron y sus pies no se hincharon!|\"Luego ayudaste a nuestros antepasados a conquistar reinos y naciones, y colocaste a tu pueblo en cada rincón de la tierra. Tomaron la tierra del rey Sehón de Hesbón y la tierra del rey Og de Basán.|Hiciste que sus descendientes fueran tan numerosos como las estrellas del cielo y los llevaste a la tierra que habías prometido a sus antepasados.|\"Entraron y tomaron posesión de la tierra. Subyugaste naciones enteras ante ellos. ¡Incluso los cananeos, que habitaban la tierra, eran impotentes! Tu pueblo pudo tratar con estas naciones y sus reyes como quisieron.|Nuestros antepasados capturaron ciudades fortificadas y tierras fértiles. Tomaron casas llenas de cosas buenas, con cisternas ya excavadas y viñedos y olivares y árboles frutales en abundancia. Así que comieron hasta saciarse y engordaron y disfrutaron de todas tus bendiciones.|\"Pero a pesar de todo esto, fueron desobedientes y se rebelaron contra ti. Dieron la espalda a tu Ley, mataron a tus profetas que les advertían que regresaran a ti, y cometieron terribles blasfemias.|Así que los entregaste a sus enemigos, que los hicieron sufrir. Pero en su tiempo de angustia clamaron a ti, y los escuchaste desde el cielo. En tu gran misericordia, les enviaste libertadores que los rescataron de sus enemigos.|\"Pero tan pronto como estaban en paz, tu pueblo nuevamente cometió maldad a tus ojos, y una vez más dejaste que sus enemigos los conquistaran. Sin embargo, cada vez que tu pueblo se volvía y clamaba a ti nuevamente por ayuda, los escuchabas una vez más desde el cielo. ¡En tu maravillosa misericordia, los rescataste muchas veces!|\"Les advertiste que regresaran a tu Ley, pero se volvieron orgullosos y obstinados y desobedecieron tus mandamientos. No siguieron tus regulaciones, por las cuales la gente encontrará vida si solo obedecen. Terco, dieron la espalda a ti y se negaron a escuchar.|En tu amor, fuiste paciente con ellos durante muchos años. Enviaste tu Espíritu, que les advirtió a través de los profetas. ¡Pero aún así no escucharon! Así que una vez más permitiste que los pueblos de la tierra los conquistaran.|Pero en tu gran misericordia, no los destruiste completamente ni los abandonaste para siempre. ¡Qué Dios tan bondadoso y misericordioso eres!|\"Y ahora, nuestro Dios, el gran y poderoso y asombroso Dios, que guarda su pacto de amor inagotable, no dejes que todas las dificultades que hemos sufrido te parezcan insignificantes. Grandes problemas han venido sobre nosotros y sobre nuestros reyes y líderes y sacerdotes y profetas y antepasados-todo tu pueblo-desde los días en que los reyes de Asiria nos vencieron por primera vez hasta ahora.|Cada vez que nos castigaste, fuiste justo. Hemos pecado gravemente, y nos diste solo lo que merecíamos.|Nuestros reyes, líderes, sacerdotes y antepasados no obedecieron tu Ley ni escucharon las advertencias en tus mandamientos y leyes.|Incluso mientras tenían su propio reino, no te sirvieron, aunque derramaste tu bondad sobre ellos. Les diste una tierra grande y fértil, pero se negaron a apartarse de su maldad.|\"Así que ahora hoy somos esclavos en la tierra de abundancia que diste a nuestros antepasados para su disfrute. ¡Somos esclavos aquí en esta buena tierra!|La abundante producción de esta tierra se acumula en manos de los reyes que has puesto sobre nosotros debido a nuestros pecados. Tienen poder sobre nosotros y nuestro ganado. Los servimos a su antojo, y estamos en gran miseria.\"\nEl Pueblo Acepta Obedecer|El pueblo respondió: \"En vista de todo esto, estamos haciendo una promesa solemne y poniéndola por escrito. En este documento sellado están los nombres de nuestros líderes, levitas y sacerdotes.\"",

      "ChapterText": "Entonces los hijos de Israel hicieron lo malo ante los ojos del Señor. Así que el Señor los entregó en manos de Madián por siete años, y la mano de Madián prevaleció contra Israel. A causa de los madianitas, los hijos de Israel se hicieron escondites, cuevas y fortalezas en las montañas. Así fue que, cada vez que Israel sembraba, los madianitas subían; también los amalecitas y los pueblos del oriente venían contra ellos. Entonces acampaban contra ellos y destruían el fruto de la tierra hasta Gaza, y no dejaban sustento en Israel, ni ovejas, ni bueyes, ni asnos. Porque subían con su ganado y sus tiendas, viniendo tan numerosos como langostas; tanto ellos como sus camellos eran innumerables; y entraban en la tierra para destruirla. Así que Israel quedó muy empobrecido a causa de los madianitas, y los hijos de Israel clamaron al Señor. Y sucedió que, cuando los hijos de Israel clamaron al Señor a causa de los madianitas, el Señor envió un profeta a los hijos de Israel, quien les dijo: Así dice el Señor Dios de Israel: Yo os saqué de Egipto y os saqué de la casa de servidumbre; y os libré de la mano de los egipcios y de la mano de todos los que os oprimían, y los expulsé delante de vosotros y os di su tierra. También os dije: Yo soy el Señor vuestro Dios; no temáis a los dioses de los amorreos, en cuya tierra habitáis. Pero no habéis obedecido mi voz. Ahora el Ángel del Señor vino y se sentó bajo la encina que estaba en Ofra, que pertenecía a Joás el abiezerita, mientras su hijo Gedeón trillaba trigo en el lagar, para esconderlo de los madianitas. Y el Ángel del Señor se le apareció y le dijo: ¡El Señor está contigo, hombre valiente! Gedeón le respondió: Oh, mi señor, si el Señor está con nosotros, ¿por qué nos ha sobrevenido todo esto? ¿Y dónde están todas sus maravillas de las que nos hablaron nuestros padres, diciendo: ¿No nos sacó el Señor de Egipto? Pero ahora el Señor nos ha abandonado y nos ha entregado en manos de los madianitas. Entonces el Señor se volvió hacia él y le dijo: Ve con esta tu fuerza, y salvarás a Israel de la mano de los madianitas. ¿No te he enviado yo? Y él le dijo: Oh, mi Señor, ¿cómo podré salvar a Israel? Mi clan es el más débil de Manasés, y yo soy el menor en la casa de mi padre. Y el Señor le dijo: Ciertamente estaré contigo, y derrotarás a los madianitas como a un solo hombre. Entonces él le dijo: Si he hallado gracia ante tus ojos, muéstrame una señal de que eres tú quien habla conmigo. No te vayas de aquí, te ruego, hasta que vuelva a ti y traiga mi ofrenda y la ponga delante de ti. Y él dijo: Esperaré hasta que vuelvas. Así que Gedeón entró y preparó un cabrito, y panes sin levadura de un efa de harina. Puso la carne en una canasta, y el caldo en una olla; y los sacó a él bajo la encina y se los presentó. El Ángel de Dios le dijo: Toma la carne y los panes sin levadura y ponlos sobre esta roca, y derrama el caldo. Y él lo hizo. Entonces el Ángel del Señor extendió la punta del bastón que tenía en su mano, y tocó la carne y los panes sin levadura; y salió fuego de la roca y consumió la carne y los panes sin levadura. Y el Ángel del Señor desapareció de su vista. Ahora Gedeón se dio cuenta de que era el Ángel del Señor. Así que Gedeón dijo: ¡Ay, Señor Dios! Porque he visto al Ángel del Señor cara a cara. Entonces el Señor le dijo: La paz sea contigo; no temas, no morirás. Así que Gedeón construyó allí un altar al Señor, y lo llamó El-Señor-Es-Paz. Hasta el día de hoy está en Ofra de los abiezeritas. Ahora sucedió que esa misma noche el Señor le dijo: Toma el toro joven de tu padre, el segundo toro de siete años, y derriba el altar de Baal que tiene tu padre, y corta la imagen de madera que está junto a él; y construye un altar al Señor tu Dios en la cima de esta roca en la disposición adecuada, y toma el segundo toro y ofrece un sacrificio quemado con la madera de la imagen que cortarás. Así que Gedeón tomó a diez hombres de entre sus siervos e hizo como el Señor le había dicho. Pero porque temía demasiado a la casa de su padre y a los hombres de la ciudad para hacerlo de día, lo hizo de noche. Y cuando los hombres de la ciudad se levantaron temprano en la mañana, allí estaba el altar de Baal, derribado; y la imagen de madera que estaba junto a él había sido cortada, y el segundo toro estaba siendo ofrecido en el altar que había sido construido. Así que se dijeron unos a otros: ¿Quién ha hecho esto? Y cuando investigaron y preguntaron, dijeron: Gedeón, el hijo de Joás, ha hecho esto. Entonces los hombres de la ciudad dijeron a Joás: Saca a tu hijo, para que muera, porque ha derribado el altar de Baal, y porque ha cortado la imagen de madera que estaba junto a él. Pero Joás dijo a todos los que estaban contra él: ¿Vais a defender a Baal? ¿Vais a salvarlo? ¡Que muera antes de la mañana el que quiera defenderlo! Si es un dios, que se defienda a sí mismo, porque su altar ha sido derribado. Por lo tanto, ese día lo llamaron Jerobaal, diciendo: Que Baal contienda contra él, porque ha derribado su altar. Entonces todos los madianitas y amalecitas, los pueblos del oriente, se reunieron; y cruzaron y acamparon en el Valle de Jezreel. Pero el Espíritu del Señor vino sobre Gedeón; entonces él tocó la trompeta, y los abiezeritas se reunieron detrás de él. Y envió mensajeros por todo Manasés, quienes también se reunieron detrás de él. También envió mensajeros a Aser, Zabulón y Neftalí; y subieron a encontrarse con ellos. Así que Gedeón dijo a Dios: Si vas a salvar a Israel por mi mano como has dicho, mira, pondré un vellón de lana en la era; si hay rocío solo en el vellón, y está seco en todo el suelo, entonces sabré que salvarás a Israel por mi mano, como has dicho. Y así fue. Cuando se levantó temprano a la mañana siguiente y exprimió el vellón, sacó el rocío del vellón, un tazón lleno de agua. Entonces Gedeón dijo a Dios: No te enojes conmigo, pero permíteme hablar solo una vez más: Déjame probar, te ruego, solo una vez más con el vellón; que ahora esté seco solo en el vellón, pero en todo el suelo haya rocío. Y Dios lo hizo así esa noche. Estaba seco solo en el vellón, pero había rocío en todo el suelo.",

      "ChapterText": "Los israelitas hicieron lo malo a los ojos del Señor. Así que el Señor los entregó a los madianitas durante siete años. Los madianitas eran tan crueles que los israelitas se hicieron escondites en las montañas, cuevas y fortalezas. Cada vez que los israelitas plantaban sus cultivos, los merodeadores de Madián, Amalec y los pueblos del este atacaban a Israel, acampando en la tierra y destruyendo cultivos hasta Gaza. Dejaban a los israelitas sin nada para comer, llevándose todas las ovejas, cabras, ganado y burros. Estas hordas enemigas, que venían con su ganado y tiendas, eran tan numerosas como langostas. Llegaban en manadas de camellos, demasiado numerosos para contar, y se quedaban hasta que la tierra quedaba desolada. Así que Israel fue reducido a la hambruna por los madianitas. Entonces los israelitas clamaron al Señor por ayuda. Cuando clamaron al Señor por causa de Madián, el Señor envió un profeta a los israelitas. Él dijo: Esto es lo que dice el Señor, el Dios de Israel: Yo los saqué de la esclavitud en Egipto. Los rescaté de los egipcios y de todos los que los oprimían. Expulsé a sus enemigos y les di su tierra. Les dije: Yo soy el Señor su Dios. No deben adorar a los dioses de los amorreos, en cuya tierra ahora viven. Pero no me han escuchado. Entonces el ángel del Señor vino y se sentó bajo el gran árbol en Ofra, que pertenecía a Joás de la familia de Abiezer. Gedeón, hijo de Joás, estaba trillando trigo en el fondo de un lagar para esconder el grano de los madianitas. El ángel del Señor se le apareció y le dijo: ¡Valiente guerrero, el Señor está contigo! Señor, respondió Gedeón, si el Señor está con nosotros, ¿por qué nos ha pasado todo esto? ¿Y dónde están todos los milagros de los que nos hablaron nuestros antepasados? ¿No dijeron que el Señor nos sacó de Egipto? Pero ahora el Señor nos ha abandonado y nos ha entregado a los madianitas. Entonces el Señor se volvió hacia él y le dijo: Ve con la fuerza que tienes y rescata a Israel de los madianitas. ¡Te envío! Pero Señor, respondió Gedeón, ¿cómo puedo rescatar a Israel? Mi familia es la más débil de toda la tribu de Manasés, y yo soy el menor de toda mi familia. El Señor le dijo: Yo estaré contigo. Y destruirás a los madianitas como si estuvieras luchando contra un solo hombre. Gedeón respondió: Si realmente vas a ayudarme, muéstrame una señal para probar que realmente es el Señor quien me habla. No te vayas hasta que regrese y traiga mi ofrenda para ti. Él respondió: Me quedaré aquí hasta que regreses. Gedeón se apresuró a casa. Cocinó un cabrito, y con una canasta de harina horneó pan sin levadura. Luego, llevando la carne en una canasta y el caldo en una olla, los sacó y los presentó al ángel, que estaba bajo el gran árbol. El ángel de Dios le dijo: Coloca la carne y el pan sin levadura sobre esta roca, y vierte el caldo sobre ellos. Y Gedeón hizo lo que se le dijo. Entonces el ángel del Señor tocó la carne y el pan con la punta del bastón en su mano, y el fuego brotó de la roca y consumió todo lo que había traído. Y el ángel del Señor desapareció. Cuando Gedeón se dio cuenta de que era el ángel del Señor, exclamó: ¡Oh, Soberano Señor, estoy perdido! ¡He visto al ángel del Señor cara a cara! Está bien, respondió el Señor. No tengas miedo. No morirás. Y Gedeón construyó un altar al Señor allí y lo llamó Yahvé-Shalom (que significa el Señor es paz). El altar permanece en Ofra en la tierra de la familia de Abiezer hasta el día de hoy. Esa noche el Señor le dijo a Gedeón: Toma el segundo toro del rebaño de tu padre, el que tiene siete años. Derriba el altar de Baal de tu padre y corta el poste de Asera que está junto a él. Luego construye un altar al Señor tu Dios aquí en este santuario en la cima de la colina, colocando las piedras cuidadosamente. Sacrifica el toro como ofrenda quemada en el altar, usando como combustible la madera del poste de Asera que cortaste. Así que Gedeón tomó a diez de sus siervos e hizo lo que el Señor le había ordenado. Pero lo hizo de noche porque tenía miedo de los otros miembros de la casa de su padre y de la gente del pueblo. Temprano a la mañana siguiente, cuando la gente del pueblo comenzó a moverse, alguien descubrió que el altar de Baal había sido derribado y que el poste de Asera junto a él había sido cortado. En su lugar se había construido un nuevo altar, y sobre él estaban los restos del toro que había sido sacrificado. La gente se dijo entre sí: ¿Quién hizo esto? Y después de preguntar y hacer una búsqueda cuidadosa, supieron que fue Gedeón, el hijo de Joás. Saca a tu hijo, exigieron los hombres del pueblo a Joás. ¡Debe morir por destruir el altar de Baal y por cortar el poste de Asera! Pero Joás gritó a la multitud que lo confrontaba: ¿Por qué están defendiendo a Baal? ¿Van a argumentar su caso? ¡Quien defienda su caso será ejecutado por la mañana! Si Baal realmente es un dios, que se defienda a sí mismo y destruya al que derribó su altar. Desde entonces a Gedeón se le llamó Jerobaal, que significa Que Baal se defienda a sí mismo, porque derribó el altar de Baal. Poco después, los ejércitos de Madián, Amalec y los pueblos del este formaron una alianza contra Israel y cruzaron el Jordán, acampando en el Valle de Jezreel. Entonces el Espíritu del Señor se apoderó de Gedeón. Tocó un cuerno de carnero como llamado a las armas, y los hombres de la familia de Abiezer acudieron a él. También envió mensajeros por todo Manasés, Aser, Zabulón y Neftalí, convocando a sus guerreros, y todos respondieron. Entonces Gedeón le dijo a Dios: Si realmente vas a usarme para rescatar a Israel como prometiste, demuéstramelo de esta manera. Pondré un vellón de lana en la era esta noche. Si el vellón está mojado con rocío por la mañana pero el suelo está seco, entonces sabré que vas a ayudarme a rescatar a Israel como prometiste. Y eso fue exactamente lo que sucedió. Cuando Gedeón se levantó temprano a la mañana siguiente, exprimió el vellón y sacó un tazón lleno de agua. Entonces Gedeón le dijo a Dios: Por favor, no te enojes conmigo, pero permíteme hacer una petición más. Déjame usar el vellón para una prueba más. Esta vez deja que el vellón permanezca seco mientras el suelo alrededor está mojado con rocío. Así que esa noche Dios hizo lo que Gedeón pidió. El vellón estaba seco por la mañana, pero el suelo estaba cubierto de rocío.",

Pero Joás dijo a todos los que estaban contra él: ¿Defenderán ustedes el caso de Baal? ¿Lo salvarán? ¡Quien defienda su caso será puesto a muerte por la mañana! Si él es un dios, que defienda su caso, porque alguien derribó su altar. Ese día, fue llamado Jerobaal, ya que Joás dijo: Que Baal contienda con él, porque derribó su altar.

El árbol pertenecía a Joás. Joás era de la familia de Abiezer. Gedeón estaba trillando trigo en un lagar. Se estaba escondiendo de los madianitas. Gedeón era hijo de Joás. El ángel del Señor se le apareció a Gedeón. Le dijo: Guerrero valiente, el Señor está contigo. Perdón, señor, respondió Gedeón. Dices que el Señor está con nosotros. Entonces, ¿por qué nos ha pasado todo esto? ¿Qué hay de todas las maravillas que ha hecho? Nuestros antepasados nos hablaron de ellas. Dijeron: ¿No nos sacó el Señor de Egipto? Pero ahora el Señor nos ha abandonado. Nos ha entregado a Madián. El Señor se volvió hacia Gedeón. Le dijo: Eres fuerte. Ve y salva a Israel del poder de Madián. Te estoy enviando. Perdón, señor, respondió Gedeón. ¿Cómo puedo salvar a Israel? Mi familia es la más débil de la tribu de Manasés. Y yo soy el menos importante de mi familia. El Señor respondió: Yo estaré contigo. Así que derrotarás a los madianitas. No dejarás a nadie con vida. Gedeón respondió: Si estás complacido conmigo, dame una señal especial. Entonces sabré que realmente eres tú quien me habla. Por favor, no te vayas hasta que regrese. Traeré mi ofrenda y la pondré delante de ti. El Señor dijo: Esperaré hasta que regreses. Gedeón fue y preparó un cabrito. De más de medio celemín de harina hizo pan sin levadura. Puso la carne en una canasta. En una olla puso sopa hecha de la carne. Luego trajo todo y lo ofreció al Señor bajo el roble. El ángel de Dios habló a Gedeón. Le dijo: Toma la carne y el pan. Colócalos sobre esta roca. Luego vierte la sopa. Así que Gedeón lo hizo. El ángel del Señor tenía un bastón de madera en su mano. Con la punta del bastón, tocó la carne y el pan. Un fuego salió de la roca. Quemó la carne y el pan. Luego el ángel del Señor desapareció. Gedeón se dio cuenta de que era el ángel del Señor. Exclamó: ¡Señor y Rey, he visto al ángel del Señor cara a cara! Pero el Señor le dijo: ¡Que la paz sea contigo! No tengas miedo. No vas a morir. Así que Gedeón construyó un altar para honrar al Señor allí. Lo llamó El Señor es Paz. Hasta el día de hoy está en Ofra. Ofra está en el territorio que pertenece a la familia de Abiezer. Esa misma noche el Señor habló a Gedeón. Le dijo: Toma el segundo toro del rebaño de tu padre. Toma el que tiene siete años. Derriba el altar que tu padre construyó a Baal. Corta el poste que está al lado. El poste se usa para adorar a la diosa Ashera. Luego construye el tipo correcto de altar. Construyelo para honrar al Señor tu Dios. Construyelo sobre esta roca. Usa las piedras adecuadas. Luego toma el segundo toro. Sacrifícalo como una ofrenda quemada. Usa la madera del poste que cortaste. Así que Gedeón fue y tomó a diez de sus siervos. Hizo tal como el Señor le había dicho. Pero tenía miedo de su familia. También tenía miedo de la gente del pueblo. Así que hizo todo de noche en lugar de durante el día. Por la mañana la gente del pueblo se levantó. ¡Allí estaba el altar de Baal! Había sido derribado. El poste que estaba al lado había sido cortado. El segundo toro había sido sacrificado en el nuevo altar. La gente se preguntó entre sí: ¿Quién hizo esto? Investigaron el asunto cuidadosamente. Alguien dijo: Gedeón, el hijo de Joás, lo hizo. La gente del pueblo habló con Joás. Le ordenaron: Saca a tu hijo aquí. Debe morir. Ha derribado el altar de Baal. Ha cortado el poste de Ashera que estaba al lado. Pero Joás respondió a la multitud enfurecida a su alrededor: ¿Van a defender a Baal? ¿Van a salvarlo? ¡Cualquiera que defienda a Baal será ejecutado por la mañana! Si Baal realmente es un dios, puede cuidarse a sí mismo. Alguien derribó su altar. Así que desde ese día, Gedeón fue llamado Jerobaal. Eso es porque Joás dijo: Que Baal se cuide a sí mismo. Alguien derribó su altar. Todos los madianitas, amalecitas y otras naciones del este unieron fuerzas. Cruzaron el río Jordán. Acamparon en el Valle de Jezreel. Entonces el Espíritu del Señor vino sobre Gedeón. Así que Gedeón tocó una trompeta para llamar a los hombres de Abiezer. Les dijo que lo siguieran. Envió mensajeros por todo el territorio de Manasés. Llamó a todos los hombres para que lo siguieran. También envió mensajeros a Aser, Zabulón y Neftalí. Así que ellos también subieron para unirse a los demás. Gedeón dijo a Dios: Prometiste que me usarías para salvar a Israel. Por favor, haz algo por mí. Pondré un trozo de lana en el suelo de trillar. Supongamos que el rocío está solo en la lana por la mañana. Supongamos que el suelo a su alrededor está seco. Entonces sabré que me usarás para salvar a Israel. Sabré que tu promesa se cumplirá. Y eso fue exactamente lo que sucedió. Gedeón se levantó temprano al día siguiente. Exprimió la lana. Sacó un tazón lleno de agua de ella. Luego Gedeón habló a Dios nuevamente. Dijo: No te enojes conmigo. Déjame pedirte solo una cosa más. Permíteme hacer una prueba más con la lana. Esta vez haz que la lana esté seca. Que el suelo esté cubierto de rocío. Así que esa noche Dios lo hizo. Solo la lana estaba seca. Todo el suelo a su alrededor estaba cubierto de rocío.",

Quiero que tengan plena confianza de que entienden el plan misterioso de Dios, que es Cristo mismo. | En él están escondidos todos los tesoros de la sabiduría y el conocimiento. | Les digo esto para que nadie los engañe con argumentos bien elaborados. | Porque aunque estoy lejos de ustedes, mi corazón está con ustedes. Y me alegra que estén viviendo como deben y que su fe en Cristo sea fuerte. | Y ahora, así como aceptaron a Cristo Jesús como su Señor, deben continuar siguiéndolo. | Dejen que sus raíces crezcan profundamente en él, y que sus vidas se construyan sobre él. Entonces su fe se fortalecerá en la verdad que les enseñaron, y rebosarán de gratitud. | No dejen que nadie los atrape con filosofías vacías y tonterías altisonantes que provienen del pensamiento humano y de los poderes espirituales de este mundo, en lugar de Cristo. | Porque en Cristo habita toda la plenitud de Dios en un cuerpo humano. | Así que también ustedes están completos mediante su unión con Cristo, quien es la cabeza sobre todo gobernante y autoridad. | Cuando vinieron a Cristo, fueron “circuncidados”, pero no mediante un procedimiento físico. Cristo realizó una circuncisión espiritual: la eliminación de su naturaleza pecaminosa. | Porque fueron sepultados con Cristo cuando fueron bautizados. Y con él fueron resucitados a una nueva vida porque confiaron en el poder poderoso de Dios, quien resucitó a Cristo de entre los muertos. | Estaban muertos a causa de sus pecados y porque su naturaleza pecaminosa aún no había sido eliminada. Entonces Dios los hizo vivir con Cristo, porque perdonó todos nuestros pecados. | Canceló el registro de los cargos en nuestra contra y lo eliminó clavándolo en la cruz. | De esta manera, desarmó a los gobernantes y autoridades espirituales. Los avergonzó públicamente con su victoria sobre ellos en la cruz. | Así que no dejen que nadie los condene por lo que comen o beben, o por no celebrar ciertos días sagrados o ceremonias de luna nueva o sábados. | Porque estas reglas son solo sombras de la realidad que está por venir. Y Cristo mismo es esa realidad. | No dejen que nadie los condene insistiendo en la negación piadosa o la adoración de ángeles, diciendo que han tenido visiones sobre estas cosas. Sus mentes pecaminosas los han hecho orgullosos, | y no están conectados a Cristo, la cabeza del cuerpo. Porque él mantiene todo el cuerpo unido con sus articulaciones y ligamentos, y crece a medida que Dios lo nutre. | Han muerto con Cristo, y él los ha liberado de los poderes espirituales de este mundo. Entonces, ¿por qué siguen obedeciendo las reglas del mundo, tales como, | “¡No manejes! ¡No pruebes! ¡No toques!”? | Tales reglas son meras enseñanzas humanas sobre cosas que se deterioran al usarlas. | Estas reglas pueden parecer sabias porque requieren una fuerte devoción, negación piadosa y severa disciplina corporal.

      "ChapterText": "The Israelites offended the LORD, who therefore delivered them into the power of Midian for seven years, | so that Midian held Israel subject. For fear of Midian the Israelites established the fire signals on the mountains, the caves for refuge, and the strongholds. | And it used to be that when the Israelites had completed their sowing, Midian, Amalek and the Kedemites would come up, | encamp opposite them, and destroy the produce of the land as far as the outskirts of Gaza, leaving no sustenance in Israel, nor sheep, oxen or asses. | For they would come up with their livestock, and their tents would become as numerous as locusts; and neither they nor their camels could be numbered, when they came into the land to lay it waste. | Thus was Israel reduced to misery by Midian, and so the Israelites cried out to the LORD. | When Israel cried out to the LORD because of Midian, | he sent a prophet to the Israelites who said to them, \"The LORD, the God of Israel, says: I led you up from Egypt; I brought you out of the place of slavery. | I rescued you from the power of Egypt and of all your other oppressors. I drove them out before you and gave you their land. | And I said to you: I, the LORD, am your God; you shall not venerate the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are dwelling. But you did not obey me.\" | Then the angel of the LORD came and sat under the terebinth in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite. While his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the wine press to save it from the Midianites, | the angel of the LORD appeared to him and said, \"The LORD is with you, O champion!\" | \"My Lord,\" Gideon said to him, \"if the LORD is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are his wondrous deeds of which our fathers told us when they said, 'Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?' For now the LORD has abandoned us and has delivered us into the power of Midian.\" | The LORD turned to him and said, \"Go with the strength you have and save Israel from the power of Midian. It is I who send you.\" | But he answered him, \"Please, my lord, how can I save Israel? My family is the meanest in Manasseh, and I am the most insignificant in my father's house.\" | \"I shall be with you,\" the LORD said to him, \"and you will cut down Midian to the last man.\" | He answered him, \"If I find favor with you, give me a sign that you are speaking with me. | Do not depart from here, I pray you, until I come back to you and bring out my offering and set it before you.\" He answered, \"I will await your return.\" | So Gideon went off and prepared a kid and an ephah of flour in the form of unleavened cakes. Putting the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, he brought them out to him under the terebinth and presented them. | The angel of God said to him, \"Take the meat and unleavened cakes and lay them on this rock; then pour out the broth.\" When he had done so, | the angel of the LORD stretched out the tip of the staff he held, and touched the meat and unleavened cakes. Thereupon a fire came up from the rock which consumed the meat and unleavened cakes, and the angel of the LORD disappeared from sight. | Gideon, now aware that it had been the angel of the LORD, said, \"Alas, Lord GOD, that I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face!\" | The LORD answered him, \"Be calm, do not fear. You shall not die.\" | So Gideon built there an altar to the LORD and called it Yahweh-shalom. To this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. | That same night the LORD said to him, \"Take the seven-year-old spare bullock and destroy your father's altar to Baal and cut down the sacred pole that is by it. | You shall build, instead, the proper kind of altar to the LORD, your God, on top of this stronghold. Then take the spare bullock and offer it as a holocaust on the wood from the sacred pole you have cut down.\" | So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the LORD had commanded him. But through fear of his family and of the townspeople, he would not do it by day, but did it at night. | Early the next morning the townspeople found that the altar of Baal had been destroyed, the sacred pole near it cut down, and the spare bullock offered on the altar that was built. | They asked one another, \"Who did this?\" Their inquiry led them to the conclusion that Gideon, son of Joash, had done it. | So the townspeople said to Joash, \"Bring out your son that he may die, for he has destroyed the altar of Baal and has cut down the sacred pole that was near it.\" | But Joash replied to all who were standing around him, \"Do you intend to act in Baal's stead, or be his champion? If anyone acts for him, he shall be put to death by morning. If he whose altar has been destroyed is a god, let him act for himself!\" | So on that day Gideon was called Jerubbaal, because of the words, \"Let Baal take action against him, since he destroyed his altar.\" | Then all Midian and Amalek and the Kedemites mustered and crossed over into the valley of Jezreel, where they encamped. | The spirit of the LORD enveloped Gideon; he blew the horn that summoned Abiezer to follow him. | He sent messengers, too, throughout Manasseh, which also obeyed his summons; through Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali, likewise, he sent messengers and these tribes advanced to meet the others. | Gideon said to God, \"If indeed you are going to save Israel through me, as you promised, | I am putting this woolen fleece on the threshing floor. If dew comes on the fleece alone, while all the ground is dry, I shall know that you will save Israel through me, as you promised.\" | That is what took place. Early the next morning he wrung the dew from the fleece, squeezing out of it a bowlful of water. | Gideon then said to God, \"Do not be angry with me if I speak once more. Let me make just one more test with the fleece. Let the fleece alone be dry, but let there be dew on all the ground.\" | That night God did so; the fleece alone was dry, but there was dew on all the ground.",

      "ChapterText": "Los israelitas ofendieron al SEÑOR, quien por eso los entregó en manos de Madián durante siete años, | de modo que Madián sometió a Israel. Por miedo a Madián, los israelitas establecieron señales de fuego en las montañas, cuevas para refugiarse y fortalezas. | Y solía suceder que cuando los israelitas terminaban de sembrar, Madián, Amalec y los hijos del oriente subían, | acampaban frente a ellos y destruían los productos de la tierra hasta las afueras de Gaza, sin dejar sustento en Israel, ni ovejas, ni bueyes, ni asnos. | Porque subían con su ganado, y sus tiendas se volvían tan numerosas como langostas; ni ellos ni sus camellos podían ser contados, cuando entraban en la tierra para devastarla. | Así fue como Madián redujo a Israel a la miseria, y los israelitas clamaron al SEÑOR. | Cuando Israel clamó al SEÑOR a causa de Madián, | él envió un profeta a los israelitas que les dijo: \"El SEÑOR, el Dios de Israel, dice: Yo los saqué de Egipto; los saqué del lugar de esclavitud. | Los rescaté del poder de Egipto y de todos sus otros opresores. Los expulsé delante de ustedes y les di su tierra. | Y les dije: Yo, el SEÑOR, soy su Dios; no veneren a los dioses de los amorreos en cuya tierra habitan. Pero no me obedecieron.\" | Entonces el ángel del SEÑOR vino y se sentó bajo la encina en Ofra que pertenecía a Joás el abiezerita. Mientras su hijo Gedeón estaba trillando trigo en el lagar para salvarlo de los madianitas, | el ángel del SEÑOR se le apareció y le dijo: \"El SEÑOR está contigo, ¡oh valiente guerrero!\" | \"Señor mío,\" le dijo Gedeón, \"si el SEÑOR está con nosotros, ¿por qué nos ha sucedido todo esto? ¿Dónde están sus maravillas de las que nos hablaron nuestros padres cuando decían: '¿No nos sacó el SEÑOR de Egipto?' Pues ahora el SEÑOR nos ha abandonado y nos ha entregado en manos de Madián.\" | El SEÑOR se volvió hacia él y le dijo: \"Ve con la fuerza que tienes y salva a Israel del poder de Madián. Soy yo quien te envía.\" | Pero él le respondió: \"Por favor, mi señor, ¿cómo puedo salvar a Israel? Mi familia es la más humilde en Manasés, y yo soy el más insignificante en la casa de mi padre.\" | \"Yo estaré contigo,\" le dijo el SEÑOR, \"y derrotarás a Madián hasta el último hombre.\" | Él le respondió: \"Si he hallado gracia ante tus ojos, dame una señal de que eres tú quien habla conmigo. | No te vayas de aquí, te ruego, hasta que vuelva a ti y traiga mi ofrenda y la ponga delante de ti.\" Él respondió: \"Esperaré tu regreso.\" | Así que Gedeón fue y preparó un cabrito y una medida de harina en forma de panes sin levadura. Puso la carne en una canasta y el caldo en una olla, y se los llevó bajo la encina y se los presentó. | El ángel de Dios le dijo: \"Toma la carne y los panes sin levadura y ponlos sobre esta roca; luego derrama el caldo.\" Cuando lo hizo, | el ángel del SEÑOR extendió la punta del bastón que tenía en la mano, y tocó la carne y los panes sin levadura. Entonces salió fuego de la roca que consumió la carne y los panes sin levadura, y el ángel del SEÑOR desapareció de su vista. | Gedeón, al darse cuenta de que había sido el ángel del SEÑOR, dijo: \"¡Ay, Señor DIOS, que he visto al ángel del SEÑOR cara a cara!\" | El SEÑOR le respondió: \"Tranquilo, no temas. No morirás.\" | Así que Gedeón construyó allí un altar al SEÑOR y lo llamó Yahvé-shalom. Hasta el día de hoy está en Ofra de los abiezeritas. | Esa misma noche el SEÑOR le dijo: \"Toma el toro de siete años de tu padre y destruye el altar de Baal de tu padre y corta el poste sagrado que está junto a él. | Construirás, en su lugar, el tipo adecuado de altar al SEÑOR, tu Dios, en la cima de esta fortaleza. Luego toma el toro y ofrécelo como holocausto sobre la madera del poste sagrado que has cortado.\" | Así que Gedeón tomó a diez de sus siervos e hizo como el SEÑOR le había mandado. Pero por miedo a su familia y a la gente del pueblo, no lo hizo de día, sino de noche. | A la mañana siguiente, la gente del pueblo encontró que el altar de Baal había sido destruido, el poste sagrado junto a él cortado, y el toro ofrecido en el altar que se había construido. | Se preguntaron unos a otros: \"¿Quién hizo esto?\" Su investigación los llevó a la conclusión de que Gedeón, hijo de Joás, lo había hecho. | Así que la gente del pueblo le dijo a Joás: \"Saca a tu hijo para que muera, porque ha destruido el altar de Baal y ha cortado el poste sagrado que estaba junto a él.\" | Pero Joás respondió a todos los que estaban a su alrededor: \"¿Pretenden actuar en lugar de Baal, o ser su defensor? Si alguien actúa por él, será muerto al amanecer.

      "ChapterText": "Entonces los hijos de Israel hicieron lo malo ante los ojos del Señor. Así que el Señor los entregó en manos de Madián por siete años, y la mano de Madián prevaleció contra Israel. A causa de los madianitas, los hijos de Israel se hicieron escondites, cuevas y fortalezas en las montañas. Así sucedía que, cuando Israel sembraba, los madianitas subían; también los amalecitas y los pueblos del oriente venían contra ellos. Acampaban contra ellos y destruían el fruto de la tierra hasta Gaza, y no dejaban sustento en Israel, ni ovejas, ni bueyes, ni asnos. Porque subían con su ganado y sus tiendas, viniendo tan numerosos como langostas; tanto ellos como sus camellos eran innumerables; y entraban en la tierra para destruirla. Así que Israel se empobreció mucho a causa de los madianitas, y los hijos de Israel clamaron al Señor. Y sucedió que, cuando los hijos de Israel clamaron al Señor a causa de los madianitas, el Señor envió un profeta a los hijos de Israel, quien les dijo: Así dice el Señor Dios de Israel: Yo los saqué de Egipto y los saqué de la casa de servidumbre; y los libré de la mano de los egipcios y de la mano de todos los que los oprimían, y los expulsé delante de ustedes y les di su tierra. También les dije: Yo soy el Señor su Dios; no teman a los dioses de los amorreos, en cuya tierra habitan. Pero no han obedecido mi voz. Ahora el Ángel del Señor vino y se sentó bajo la encina que estaba en Ofra, que pertenecía a Joás el abiezerita, mientras su hijo Gedeón trillaba trigo en el lagar, para esconderlo de los madianitas. Y el Ángel del Señor se le apareció y le dijo: ¡El Señor está contigo, valiente guerrero! Gedeón le respondió: Oh, mi señor, si el Señor está con nosotros, ¿por qué nos ha sobrevenido todo esto? ¿Y dónde están todas sus maravillas de las que nos hablaron nuestros padres, diciendo: ¿No nos sacó el Señor de Egipto? Pero ahora el Señor nos ha abandonado y nos ha entregado en manos de los madianitas. Entonces el Señor se volvió hacia él y le dijo: Ve con esta tu fuerza, y salvarás a Israel de la mano de los madianitas. ¿No te he enviado yo? Y él le respondió: Oh, mi Señor, ¿cómo podré salvar a Israel? Mi clan es el más débil de Manasés, y yo soy el menor en la casa de mi padre. Y el Señor le dijo: Ciertamente estaré contigo, y derrotarás a los madianitas como a un solo hombre. Entonces él le dijo: Si he hallado gracia ante tus ojos, muéstrame una señal de que eres tú quien habla conmigo. No te vayas de aquí, te ruego, hasta que vuelva a ti y traiga mi ofrenda y la ponga delante de ti. Y él dijo: Esperaré hasta que vuelvas. Así que Gedeón entró y preparó un cabrito, y panes sin levadura de un efa de harina. Puso la carne en una canasta, y el caldo en una olla; y los llevó a él bajo la encina y se los presentó. El Ángel de Dios le dijo: Toma la carne y los panes sin levadura y ponlos sobre esta roca, y derrama el caldo. Y él lo hizo. Entonces el Ángel del Señor extendió la punta del bastón que tenía en su mano, y tocó la carne y los panes sin levadura; y salió fuego de la roca y consumió la carne y los panes sin levadura. Y el Ángel del Señor desapareció de su vista. Ahora Gedeón se dio cuenta de que era el Ángel del Señor. Así que Gedeón dijo: ¡Ay, Señor Dios! Porque he visto al Ángel del Señor cara a cara. Entonces el Señor le dijo: La paz sea contigo; no temas, no morirás. Así que Gedeón construyó allí un altar al Señor, y lo llamó El-Señor-Es-Paz. Hasta el día de hoy está en Ofra de los abiezeritas. Ahora sucedió que esa misma noche el Señor le dijo: Toma el toro joven de tu padre, el segundo toro de siete años, y derriba el altar de Baal que tiene tu padre, y corta la imagen de madera que está junto a él; y construye un altar al Señor tu Dios en la cima de esta roca en la disposición adecuada, y toma el segundo toro y ofrece un sacrificio quemado con la madera de la imagen que cortarás. Así que Gedeón tomó a diez hombres de entre sus siervos e hizo como el Señor le había dicho. Pero porque temía demasiado a la casa de su padre y a los hombres de la ciudad para hacerlo de día, lo hizo de noche. Y cuando los hombres de la ciudad se levantaron temprano en la mañana, allí estaba el altar de Baal derribado; y la imagen de madera que estaba junto a él había sido cortada, y el segundo toro estaba siendo ofrecido en el altar que había sido construido. Así que se dijeron unos a otros: ¿Quién ha hecho esto? Y cuando investigaron y preguntaron, dijeron: Gedeón, el hijo de Joás, ha hecho esto. Entonces los hombres de la ciudad dijeron a Joás: Saca a tu hijo, para que muera, porque ha derribado el altar de Baal, y porque ha cortado la imagen de madera que estaba junto a él. Pero Joás dijo a todos los que estaban contra él: ¿Defenderán ustedes a Baal? ¿Lo salvarán? ¡Que muera al amanecer el que lo defienda! Si es un dios, que se defienda a sí mismo, porque su altar ha sido derribado. Por lo tanto, ese día lo llamaron Jerobaal, diciendo: Que Baal contienda contra él, porque ha derribado su altar. Entonces todos los madianitas y amalecitas, los pueblos del oriente, se reunieron; y cruzaron y acamparon en el Valle de Jezreel. Pero el Espíritu del Señor vino sobre Gedeón; entonces él tocó la trompeta, y los abiezeritas se reunieron detrás de él. Y envió mensajeros por todo Manasés, quienes también se reunieron detrás de él. También envió mensajeros a Aser, Zabulón y Neftalí; y subieron a encontrarse con ellos. Así que Gedeón dijo a Dios: Si vas a salvar a Israel por mi mano como has dicho, mira, pondré un vellón de lana en la era; si hay rocío solo en el vellón, y está seco en todo el suelo, entonces sabré que salvarás a Israel por mi mano, como has dicho. Y así fue. Cuando se levantó temprano a la mañana siguiente y exprimió el vellón, sacó el rocío del vellón, un tazón lleno de agua. Entonces Gedeón dijo a Dios: No te enojes conmigo, pero permíteme hablar solo una vez más: Déjame probar, te ruego, solo una vez más con el vellón; que ahora esté seco solo en el vellón, pero en todo el suelo haya rocío. Y Dios lo hizo así esa noche. Estaba seco solo en el vellón, pero había rocío en todo el suelo.",

      "ChapterText": "Los israelitas hicieron lo malo a los ojos del Señor. Así que el Señor los entregó a los madianitas durante siete años. Los madianitas eran tan crueles que los israelitas se hicieron escondites en las montañas, cuevas y fortalezas. Cada vez que los israelitas plantaban sus cultivos, los merodeadores de Madián, Amalec y los pueblos del este atacaban a Israel, acampando en la tierra y destruyendo los cultivos hasta Gaza. Dejaban a los israelitas sin nada para comer, llevándose todas las ovejas, cabras, ganado y burros. Estas hordas enemigas, que venían con su ganado y tiendas, eran tan numerosas como langostas. Llegaban en manadas de camellos, demasiado numerosos para contar, y se quedaban hasta que la tierra quedaba desolada. Así que Israel fue reducido a la hambruna por los madianitas. Entonces los israelitas clamaron al Señor por ayuda. Cuando clamaron al Señor a causa de Madián, el Señor envió un profeta a los israelitas. Él dijo: Esto es lo que dice el Señor, el Dios de Israel: Yo los saqué de la esclavitud en Egipto. Los rescaté de los egipcios y de todos los que los oprimían. Expulsé a sus enemigos y les di su tierra. Les dije: Yo soy el Señor su Dios. No deben adorar a los dioses de los amorreos, en cuya tierra ahora viven. Pero no me han escuchado. Entonces el ángel del Señor vino y se sentó bajo el gran árbol en Ofra, que pertenecía a Joás del clan de Abiezer. Gedeón, hijo de Joás, estaba trillando trigo en el fondo de un lagar para esconder el grano de los madianitas. El ángel del Señor se le apareció y le dijo: ¡Valiente guerrero, el Señor está contigo! Señor, respondió Gedeón, si el Señor está con nosotros, ¿por qué nos ha sucedido todo esto? ¿Y dónde están todos los milagros de los que nos hablaron nuestros antepasados? ¿No dijeron que el Señor nos sacó de Egipto? Pero ahora el Señor nos ha abandonado y nos ha entregado a los madianitas. Entonces el Señor se volvió hacia él y le dijo: Ve con la fuerza que tienes y rescata a Israel de los madianitas. ¡Te envío! Pero Señor, respondió Gedeón, ¿cómo puedo rescatar a Israel? ¡Mi clan es el más débil de toda la tribu de Manasés, y yo soy el menor de toda mi familia! El Señor le dijo: Yo estaré contigo. Y destruirás a los madianitas como si estuvieras luchando contra un solo hombre. Gedeón respondió: Si realmente vas a ayudarme, muéstrame una señal para probar que realmente es el Señor quien me habla. No te vayas hasta que regrese y traiga mi ofrenda para ti. Él respondió: Me quedaré aquí hasta que regreses. Gedeón se apresuró a ir a casa. Cocinó un cabrito y con una canasta de harina horneó pan sin levadura. Luego, llevando la carne en una canasta y el caldo en una olla, los sacó y los presentó al ángel, que estaba bajo el gran árbol. El ángel de Dios le dijo: Coloca la carne y el pan sin levadura sobre esta roca y vierte el caldo sobre ellos. Y Gedeón hizo lo que se le dijo. Entonces el ángel del Señor tocó la carne y el pan con la punta del bastón que tenía en la mano, y el fuego brotó de la roca y consumió todo lo que había traído. Y el ángel del Señor desapareció. Cuando Gedeón se dio cuenta de que era el ángel del Señor, exclamó: ¡Oh, Soberano Señor, estoy perdido! ¡He visto al ángel del Señor cara a cara! Está bien, respondió el Señor. No temas. No morirás. Y Gedeón construyó un altar al Señor allí y lo llamó Yahweh-Shalom (que significa el Señor es paz). El altar permanece en Ofra en la tierra del clan de Abiezer hasta el día de hoy. Esa noche el Señor le dijo a Gedeón: Toma el segundo toro del rebaño de tu padre, el que tiene siete años. Derriba el altar de Baal de tu padre y corta el poste de Asera que está junto a él. Luego construye un altar al Señor tu Dios aquí en este santuario en la cima de la colina, colocando las piedras cuidadosamente. Sacrifica el toro como ofrenda quemada en el altar, usando como combustible la madera del poste de Asera que cortaste. Así que Gedeón tomó a diez de sus siervos e hizo lo que el Señor le había mandado. Pero lo hizo de noche porque tenía miedo de los otros miembros de la casa de su padre y de la gente del pueblo. Temprano a la mañana siguiente, cuando la gente del pueblo comenzó a moverse, alguien descubrió que el altar de Baal había sido derribado y que el poste de Asera junto a él había sido cortado. En su lugar se había construido un nuevo altar, y sobre él estaban los restos del toro que había sido sacrificado. La gente se dijo entre sí: ¿Quién hizo esto? Y después de preguntar y hacer una búsqueda cuidadosa, se enteraron de que fue Gedeón, el hijo de Joás. Saca a tu hijo, exigieron los hombres del pueblo a Joás. ¡Debe morir por destruir el altar de Baal y por cortar el poste de Asera! Pero Joás gritó a la multitud que lo confrontaba: ¿Por qué están defendiendo a Baal? ¿Van a argumentar su caso? ¡Quien defienda su caso será ejecutado por la mañana! Si Baal realmente es un dios, que se defienda a sí mismo y destruya al que derribó su altar. Desde entonces a Gedeón se le llamó Jerobaal, que significa Que Baal se defienda a sí mismo, porque derribó el altar de Baal. Poco después, los ejércitos de Madián, Amalec y los pueblos del este formaron una alianza contra Israel y cruzaron el Jordán, acampando en el Valle de Jezreel. Entonces el Espíritu del Señor se apoderó de Gedeón. Tocó un cuerno de carnero como llamado a las armas, y los hombres del clan de Abiezer acudieron a él. También envió mensajeros por todo Manasés, Aser, Zabulón y Neftalí, convocando a sus guerreros, y todos respondieron. Entonces Gedeón dijo a Dios: Si realmente vas a usarme para rescatar a Israel como prometiste, demuéstramelo de esta manera. Pondré un vellón de lana en la era esta noche. Si el vellón está mojado con rocío por la mañana pero el suelo está seco, entonces sabré que vas a ayudarme a rescatar a Israel como prometiste. Y eso fue exactamente lo que sucedió. Cuando Gedeón se levantó temprano a la mañana siguiente, exprimió el vellón y sacó un tazón lleno de agua. Entonces Gedeón dijo a Dios: Por favor, no te enojes conmigo, pero permíteme hacer una petición más. Déjame usar el vellón para una prueba más. Esta vez deja que el vellón permanezca seco mientras el suelo alrededor esté mojado con rocío. Así que esa noche Dios hizo lo que Gedeón pidió. El vellón estaba seco por la mañana, pero el suelo estaba cubierto de rocío.",

Por eso los israelitas hicieron lugares para esconderse en las montañas. También hicieron cuevas y fortalezas. Cada vez que los israelitas plantaban sus cultivos, la gente de Madián, Amalec y otras naciones del este venían y los atacaban. Acampaban en la tierra. Destruían los cultivos hasta Gaza.

Así que derrotarás a los madianitas. No dejarás a nadie con vida. Gedeón respondió: Si estás complacido conmigo, dame una señal especial. Entonces sabré que realmente eres tú quien me habla. Por favor, no te vayas hasta que regrese. Traeré mi ofrenda y la pondré delante de ti. El Señor dijo: Esperaré hasta que regreses. Gedeón fue y preparó un cabrito.

El ángel de Dios habló a Gedeón. Le dijo: Toma la carne y el pan. Colócalos sobre esta roca. Luego vierte la sopa. Así que Gedeón lo hizo. El ángel del Señor tenía un bastón de madera en su mano. Con la punta del bastón, tocó la carne y el pan. Un fuego salió de la roca. Quemó la carne y el pan. Luego el ángel del Señor desapareció. Gedeón se dio cuenta de que era el ángel del Señor. Exclamó: ¡Señor y Rey, he visto al ángel del Señor cara a cara! Pero el Señor le dijo: ¡Que la paz sea contigo! No tengas miedo. No vas a morir. Así que Gedeón construyó un altar para honrar al Señor allí. Lo llamó El Señor es Paz. Hasta el día de hoy está en Ofra. Ofra está en el territorio que pertenece a la familia de Abiezer. Esa misma noche el Señor habló a Gedeón. Le dijo: Toma el segundo toro del rebaño de tu padre. Toma el que tiene siete años. Derriba el altar que tu padre construyó a Baal. Corta el poste que está al lado. El poste se usa para adorar a la diosa Ashera. Luego construye el tipo correcto de altar. Construyelo para honrar al Señor tu Dios. Construyelo sobre esta roca. Usa las piedras adecuadas. Luego toma el segundo toro. Sacrifícalo como una ofrenda quemada. Usa la madera del poste que cortaste. Así que Gedeón fue y reunió a diez de sus siervos. Hizo tal como el Señor le había dicho. Pero tenía miedo de su familia. También tenía miedo de la gente del pueblo. Así que hizo todo de noche en lugar de durante el día. Por la mañana la gente del pueblo se levantó. ¡Allí estaba el altar de Baal! Había sido derribado. El poste que estaba al lado había sido cortado. El segundo toro había sido sacrificado en el nuevo altar. La gente se preguntó entre sí: ¿Quién hizo esto? Investigaron el asunto cuidadosamente. Alguien dijo: Gedeón, el hijo de Joás, lo hizo. La gente del pueblo habló con Joás. Le ordenaron: Saca a tu hijo aquí. Debe morir. Ha derribado el altar de Baal. Ha cortado el poste de Ashera que estaba al lado. Pero Joás respondió a la multitud enojada a su alrededor: ¿Van a defender a Baal? ¿Van a salvarlo? ¡Cualquiera que defienda a Baal será ejecutado por la mañana! Si Baal realmente es un dios, puede cuidarse solo. Alguien derribó su altar. Así que desde ese día, Gedeón fue llamado Jerobaal. Eso es porque Joás dijo: Que Baal se cuide solo. Alguien derribó su altar. Todos los madianitas, amalecitas y otras naciones del este unieron fuerzas. Cruzaron el río Jordán. Acamparon en el Valle de Jezreel. Entonces el Espíritu del Señor vino sobre Gedeón. Así que Gedeón tocó una trompeta para llamar a los hombres de Abiezer. Les dijo que lo siguieran. Envió mensajeros por todo el territorio de Manasés. Llamó a todos los hombres para que lo siguieran. También envió mensajeros a Aser, Zabulón y Neftalí. Así que ellos también subieron para unirse a los demás. Gedeón dijo a Dios: Prometiste que me usarías para salvar a Israel. Por favor, haz algo por mí. Pondré un trozo de lana en el suelo de trillar. Supongamos que el rocío está solo en la lana por la mañana. Supongamos que el suelo alrededor está seco. Entonces sabré que me usarás para salvar a Israel. Sabré que tu promesa se cumplirá. Y eso fue exactamente lo que sucedió. Gedeón se levantó temprano al día siguiente. Exprimió la lana. Sacó un tazón lleno de agua de ella. Luego Gedeón habló a Dios de nuevo. Dijo: No te enojes conmigo. Déjame pedirte solo una cosa más. Permíteme hacer una prueba más con la lana. Esta vez haz que la lana esté seca. Que el suelo esté cubierto de rocío. Así que esa noche Dios lo hizo. Solo la lana estaba seca. Todo el suelo alrededor estaba cubierto de rocío.",

I am as when the fruit is gathered, as when the vines have been gleaned; There is no cluster to eat, no early fig that I crave. | The faithful are gone from the earth, among men the upright are no more! They all lie in wait to shed blood, each one ensnares the other. | Their hands succeed at evil; the prince makes demands, The judge is had for a price, The great man speaks as he pleases, | The best of them is like a brier, the most upright like a thorn hedge. The day announced by your watchmen! your punishment has come; now is the time of your confusion. | Put no trust in a friend, have no confidence in a companion; Against her who lies in your bosom guard the portals of your mouth. | For the son dishonors his father, the daughter rises up against her mother, The daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law, and a man's enemies are those of his household. | But as for me, I will look to the LORD, I will put my trust in God my savior; my God will hear me! | Rejoice not over me, O my enemy! though I have fallen, I will arise; though I sit in darkness, the LORD is my light. | The wrath of the LORD I will endure because I have sinned against him, Until he takes up my cause, and establishes my right. He will bring me forth to the light; I will see his justice. | When my enemy sees this, shame shall cover her: She who said to me, \"Where is the LORD, thy God?\" My eyes shall see her downfall; now shall she be trampled underfoot, like the mire in the streets. | It is the day for building your walls; on that day the boundary shall be taken away. | It is the day; and they shall come to you from Assyria and from Egypt, From Tyre even to the River, from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain; | And the land shall be a waste because of its citizens, as a result of their deeds. | Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock of your inheritance, That dwells apart in a woodland, in the midst of Carmel. Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old; | As in the days when you came from the land of Egypt, show us wonderful signs. | The nations shall behold and be put to shame, in spite of all their strength; They shall put their hands over their mouths; their ears shall become deaf. | They shall lick the dust like the serpent, like reptiles on the ground; They shall come quaking from their fastnesses, trembling in fear of you (the LORD, our God). | Who is there like you, the God who removes guilt and pardons sin for the remnant of his inheritance; Who does not persist in anger forever, but delights rather in clemency, | And will again have compassion on us, treading underfoot our guilt? You will cast into the depths of the sea all our sins; | You will show faithfulness to Jacob, and grace to Abraham, As you have sworn to our fathers from days of old.",

Todos acechan para derramar sangre; cada uno caza a su hermano con una red. | Para que puedan hacer el mal con ambas manos—el príncipe pide regalos, el juez busca un soborno, y el gran hombre expresa su mal deseo; así traman juntos. | El mejor de ellos es como un espino; el más recto es más afilado que un seto de espinas; el día de tu vigilante y tu castigo llega; ahora será su perplejidad. | No confíes en un amigo; no pongas tu confianza en un compañero; guarda las puertas de tu boca de la que yace en tu seno. | Porque el hijo deshonra al padre, la hija se levanta contra su madre, la nuera contra su suegra; los enemigos de un hombre son los de su propia casa. | Por lo tanto, miraré al Señor; esperaré al Dios de mi salvación; mi Dios me escuchará. | No te regocijes sobre mí, mi enemigo; cuando caiga, me levantaré; cuando me siente en la oscuridad, el Señor será una luz para mí. | Soportaré la indignación del Señor, porque he pecado contra Él, hasta que Él defienda mi causa y ejecute justicia para mí.

No retiene Su ira para siempre, porque se deleita en la misericordia. | Volverá a tener compasión de nosotros, y subyugará nuestras iniquidades.

Todos son asesinos, tendiendo trampas incluso a sus propios hermanos. | ¡Ambas manos son igualmente hábiles para hacer el mal! Funcionarios y jueces por igual exigen sobornos.

Espero con confianza que Dios me salve, y mi Dios ciertamente me escuchará. | ¡No te burles de mí, mis enemigos! Porque aunque caiga, me levantaré de nuevo. Aunque me siente en la oscuridad, el Señor será mi luz. | Seré paciente mientras el Señor me castiga, porque he pecado contra él. Pero después de eso, él tomará mi caso y me hará justicia por todo lo que he sufrido de mis enemigos. El Señor me llevará a la luz, y veré su justicia. | Entonces mis enemigos verán que el Señor está de mi lado. Se avergonzarán de haberme burlado, diciendo: “¿Dónde está el Señor, ese Dios tuyo?” Con mis propios ojos veré su caída; serán pisoteados como lodo en las calles. | En ese día, Israel, tus ciudades serán reconstruidas, y tus fronteras se extenderán. | Gente de muchas tierras vendrá y te honrará, desde Asiria hasta las ciudades de Egipto, desde Egipto hasta el río Éufrates, y desde mares y montañas distantes. | Pero la tierra se volverá vacía y desolada por la maldad de los que viven allí. | Oh Señor, protege a tu pueblo con el bastón de tu pastor; guía a tu rebaño, tu posesión especial. Aunque vivan solos en un matorral en las alturas del Monte Carmelo, déjalos pastar en los fértiles pastos de Basán y Galaad como lo hicieron hace mucho tiempo. | “Sí,” dice el Señor, “haré milagros poderosos para ustedes, como los que hice cuando los rescaté de la esclavitud en Egipto.” | Todas las naciones del mundo estarán asombradas por lo que el Señor hará por ustedes. Se sentirán avergonzadas de su débil poder. Cubrirán sus bocas en silencioso asombro, sordas a todo lo que las rodea. | Como serpientes saliendo de sus agujeros, saldrán a encontrarse con el Señor nuestro Dios. Lo temerán grandemente, temblando de terror en su presencia. | ¿Dónde hay otro Dios como tú, que perdona la culpa del remanente, pasando por alto los pecados de su pueblo especial? No te quedarás enojado con tu pueblo para siempre, porque te deleitas en mostrar amor inquebrantable. | Una vez más tendrás compasión de nosotros. Pisotearás nuestros pecados bajo tus pies y los arrojarás a las profundidades del océano. | Nos mostrarás tu fidelidad y amor inquebrantable como prometiste a nuestros antepasados Abraham y Jacob hace mucho tiempo.",

seca;\n Y arrojaste a sus perseguidores a las profundidades,\n Como una piedra en aguas turbulentas.|\"Y con una columna de nube los guiaste de día,\n Y con una columna de fuego de noche\n Para iluminarles el camino\n Por el cual debían ir.|\"Entonces descendiste al monte Sinaí,\n Y hablaste con ellos desde el cielo;\n Les diste ordenanzas justas y leyes verdaderas,\n Buenos estatutos y mandamientos.|\"Así les diste a conocer Tu santo sábado,\n Y les diste mandamientos, estatutos y ley,\n A través de Tu siervo Moisés.|\"Proveíste pan del cielo para ellos por su hambre,\n Sacaste agua de una roca para ellos por su sed,\n Y les dijiste que entraran para tomar posesión de\n La tierra que juraste darles.|\"Pero ellos, nuestros padres, actuaron con arrogancia;\n Se volvieron tercos y no escucharon Tus mandamientos.|\"Rehusaron escuchar,\n Y no recordaron Tus obras maravillosas que realizaste entre ellos;\n Así que se volvieron tercos y nombraron un líder para regresar a su esclavitud en Egipto.\n Pero Tú eres un Dios de perdón,\n Gracioso y compasivo,\n Lento para la ira y abundante en misericordia;\n Y no los abandonaste.|\"Incluso cuando se hicieron para sí mismos\n

hincharon.|\"También les diste reinos y pueblos,\n Y los asignaste como límite.\n Tomaron posesión de la tierra de Sehón, rey de Hesbón,\n Y la tierra de Og, rey de Basán.|\"Hiciste a sus hijos tan numerosos como las estrellas del cielo,\n Y los llevaste a la tierra\n Que habías dicho a sus padres que entraran y poseyeran.|\"Así que sus hijos entraron y tomaron posesión de la tierra.\n Y sometiste ante ellos a los habitantes de la tierra, los cananeos,\n Y los entregaste en sus manos, con sus reyes y los pueblos de la tierra,\n Para que hicieran con ellos lo que quisieran.|\"Capturaron ciudades fortificadas y una tierra fértil.\n Tomaron posesión de casas llenas de toda buena cosa,\n Cisternas excavadas, viñedos, olivares,\n Árboles frutales en abundancia.\n Así que comieron, se saciaron y engordaron,\n Y vivieron lujosamente en Tu gran bondad.|\"Pero se rebelaron y se levantaron contra Ti,\n Y echaron Tu Ley detrás de sus espaldas\n Y mataron a Tus profetas que los habían amonestado\n Para hacerlos volver a Ti,\n Y cometieron grandes blasfemias.|\"Por lo tanto, los entregaste en manos de sus enemigos que los oprimieron,\n Pero cuando clamaron a Ti en el tiempo de su angustia,\n Escuchaste desde el cielo, y según Tu gran compasión\n Les diste personas que los salvaron de la mano de sus enemigos.|\"Pero tan pronto como tuvieron descanso, volvieron a hacer el mal ante Ti;\n Por lo tanto, los abandonaste en manos de sus enemigos, para que los gobernaran.\n Cuando clamaron de nuevo a Ti, escuchaste desde el cielo,\n Y muchas veces los rescataste según Tu compasión,|Y los amonestaste para hacerlos volver a Tu Ley.\n Sin embargo, actuaron con arrogancia y no escucharon Tus mandamientos, sino que pecaron contra Tus ordenanzas,\n Que, si una persona las sigue, entonces vivirá por ellas.\n Y volvieron un hombro terco y endurecieron su cuello, y no quisieron escuchar.|\"Sin embargo, fuiste paciente con ellos durante muchos años,\n Y los amonestaste por Tu Espíritu a través de Tus profetas,\n Sin embargo, no quisieron escuchar.\n Por lo tanto, los entregaste a los pueblos de las tierras.|\"No obstante, en Tu gran compasión no los exterminaste ni los abandonaste,\n Porque Tú eres un Dios gracioso y compasivo.|\"Ahora bien, nuestro Dios, el grande, el poderoso y el temible Dios, que guarda Su pacto y fidelidad,\n No dejes que toda la dificultad parezca insignificante ante Ti,\n Que nos ha sucedido a nosotros, nuestros reyes, nuestros líderes, nuestros sacerdotes, nuestros profetas, nuestros padres y a todo Tu pueblo,\n Desde los días de los reyes de Asiria hasta este día.|\"Sin embargo, Tú eres justo en todo lo que nos ha sucedido;\n Porque has actuado fielmente, pero nosotros hemos actuado malvadamente.|\"Porque nuestros reyes, nuestros líderes, nuestros sacerdotes y nuestros padres no han guardado Tu Ley\n Ni prestaron atención a Tus mandamientos y Tus amonestaciones con las que los amonestaste.|\"Pero

      "ChapterText": "Ahora, en el vigésimo cuarto día de este mes, el pueblo de Israel se reunió con ayuno y con cilicio, y con tierra sobre sus cabezas. | Y los israelitas se separaron de todos los extranjeros y se pusieron de pie y confesaron sus pecados y las iniquidades de sus padres. | Y se pusieron de pie en su lugar y leyeron del Libro de la Ley del SEÑOR su Dios durante un cuarto del día; durante otro cuarto confesaron y adoraron al SEÑOR su Dios. | En las escaleras de los levitas estaban Jesúa, Bani, Cadmiel, Sebanías, Buni, Serebías, Bani y Quenaní; y clamaron con fuerte voz al SEÑOR su Dios. | Entonces los levitas, Jesúa, Cadmiel, Bani, Hasabneías, Serebías, Hodías, Sebanías y Petahías, dijeron: \"Levántense y bendigan al SEÑOR su Dios desde la eternidad hasta la eternidad. Bendito sea tu glorioso nombre, que está exaltado sobre toda bendición y alabanza. | \"Tú eres el SEÑOR, solo tú. Tú hiciste el cielo, el cielo de los cielos, con todo su ejército, la tierra y todo lo que hay en ella, los mares y todo lo que hay en ellos; y tú preservas a todos ellos; y el ejército del cielo te adora. | Tú eres el SEÑOR, el Dios que eligió a Abram y lo sacó de Ur de los caldeos y le diste el nombre de Abraham. | Encontraste su corazón fiel ante ti, e hiciste con él el pacto de dar a su descendencia la tierra del cananeo, el hitita, el amorreo, el ferezeo, el jebuseo y el gergeseo. Y has cumplido tu promesa, porque eres justo. | \"Y viste la aflicción de nuestros padres en Egipto y escuchaste su clamor en el Mar Rojo, | e hiciste señales y maravillas contra Faraón y todos sus siervos y todo el pueblo de su tierra, porque sabías que actuaron con arrogancia contra nuestros padres. Y te hiciste un nombre, como es hasta hoy. | Y dividiste el mar delante de ellos, para que pasaran por en medio del mar en tierra seca, y arrojaste a sus perseguidores a las profundidades, como una piedra en aguas poderosas. | Con una columna de nube los guiaste de día, y con una columna de fuego de noche para iluminarles el camino por el que debían ir. | Descendiste al monte Sinaí y hablaste con ellos desde el cielo y les diste reglas justas y leyes verdaderas, buenos estatutos y mandamientos, | y les diste a conocer tu santo sábado y les ordenaste mandamientos y estatutos y una ley por medio de Moisés tu siervo. | Les diste pan del cielo para su hambre y sacaste agua de la roca para su sed, y les dijiste que entraran a poseer la tierra que habías jurado darles. | \"Pero ellos y nuestros padres actuaron con presunción y endurecieron su cerviz y no obedecieron tus mandamientos. | Rehusaron obedecer y no recordaron las maravillas que hiciste entre ellos, sino que endurecieron su cerviz y nombraron un líder para regresar a su esclavitud en Egipto. Pero tú eres un Dios dispuesto a perdonar, clemente y misericordioso, lento para la ira y abundante en amor constante, y no los abandonaste. | Incluso cuando se hicieron un becerro de oro y dijeron: 'Este es tu Dios que te sacó de Egipto', y cometieron grandes blasfemias, | tú, en tu gran misericordia, no los abandonaste en el desierto. La columna de nube para guiarlos en el camino no se apartó de ellos de día, ni la columna de fuego de noche para iluminarles el camino por el que debían ir. | Les diste tu buen Espíritu para instruirlos y no les negaste tu maná de su boca y les diste agua para su sed. | Cuarenta años los sustentaste en el desierto, y no les faltó nada. Sus ropas no se desgastaron y sus pies no se hincharon. | \"Y les diste reinos y pueblos y les asignaste cada rincón. Así que tomaron posesión de la tierra de Sehón, rey de Hesbón, y de la tierra de Og, rey de Basán. | Multiplicaste sus hijos como las estrellas del cielo, y los llevaste a la tierra que habías dicho a sus padres que entraran y poseyeran. | Así que los descendientes entraron y poseyeron la tierra, y sometiste ante ellos a los habitantes de la tierra, los cananeos, y los entregaste en su mano, con sus reyes y los pueblos de la tierra, para que hicieran con ellos lo que quisieran. | Y capturaron ciudades fortificadas y una tierra rica, y tomaron posesión de casas llenas de toda clase de bienes, cisternas ya excavadas, viñedos, olivares y árboles frutales en abundancia. Así que comieron y se saciaron y se engordaron y se deleitaron en tu gran bondad. | \"Sin embargo, fueron desobedientes y se rebelaron contra ti y echaron tu ley detrás de sus espaldas y mataron a tus profetas, que los habían advertido para hacerlos volver a ti, y cometieron grandes blasfemias. | Por lo tanto, los entregaste en manos de sus enemigos, que los hicieron sufrir. Y en el tiempo de su sufrimiento clamaron a ti y los escuchaste desde el cielo, y según tus grandes misericordias les diste salvadores que los salvaron de la mano de sus enemigos. | Pero después de que tuvieron descanso, volvieron a hacer el mal ante ti, y los abandonaste en manos de sus enemigos, para que tuvieran dominio sobre ellos. Sin embargo, cuando se volvieron y clamaron a ti, los escuchaste desde el cielo, y muchas veces los libraste según tus misericordias. | Y los advertiste para hacerlos volver a tu ley. Sin embargo, actuaron con presunción y no obedecieron tus mandamientos, sino que pecaron contra tus reglas, que si una persona las hace, vivirá por ellas, y volvieron un hombro terco y endurecieron su cerviz y no quisieron obedecer. | Muchos años los soportaste y los advertiste por tu Espíritu a través de tus profetas. Sin embargo, no quisieron escuchar. Por lo tanto, los entregaste en manos de los pueblos de las tierras. | No obstante, en tus grandes misericordias no los exterminaste ni los abandonaste, porque eres un Dios clemente y misericordioso. | \"Ahora, por lo tanto, nuestro Dios, el grande, el poderoso y el temible Dios, que guarda el pacto y el amor constante, no dejes que toda la aflicción que ha venido sobre nosotros, sobre nuestros reyes, nuestros príncipes, nuestros sacerdotes, nuestros profetas, nuestros padres y todo tu pueblo, desde el tiempo de los reyes de Asiria hasta este día, parezca poca cosa ante ti. | Sin embargo, has sido justo en todo lo que ha venido sobre nosotros, porque has actuado fielmente y nosotros hemos actuado malvadamente. | Nuestros reyes, nuestros príncipes, nuestros sacerdotes y nuestros padres no han guardado tu ley ni prestado atención a tus mandamientos y tus advertencias que les diste. | Incluso en su propio reino, disfrutando de tu gran bondad que les diste, y en la tierra grande y rica que pusiste delante de ellos, no te sirvieron ni se apartaron de sus malas obras. | He aquí, somos esclavos hoy; en la tierra que diste a nuestros padres para disfrutar de su fruto y sus buenos dones, he aquí, somos esclavos. | Y su rica producción va a los reyes que has puesto sobre nosotros por causa de nuestros pecados. Ellos gobiernan sobre nuestros cuerpos y sobre nuestro ganado como les place, y estamos en gran angustia. | \"Por todo esto hacemos un firme pacto por escrito; en el documento sellado están los nombres de nuestros príncipes, nuestros levitas y nuestros sacerdotes.\"",

Tal persona es el engañador y el anticristo. | Cuídense, para que no pierdan lo que hemos trabajado, sino que reciban una recompensa completa. | Todo el que se adelanta y no permanece en la enseñanza de Cristo, no tiene a Dios. Quien permanece en la enseñanza tiene tanto al Padre como al Hijo. | Si alguien viene a ustedes y no trae esta enseñanza, no lo reciban en su casa ni le den ningún saludo, | porque quien lo saluda participa en sus malas obras. | Aunque tengo mucho que escribirles, prefiero no usar papel y tinta. En cambio, espero ir a verlos y hablar cara a cara, para que nuestra alegría sea completa. | Los hijos de tu hermana elegida te saludan.",

      "ChapterText": "Yo, el anciano, estoy escribiendo esta carta. La envío a la señora elegida por Dios y a sus hijos. Los amo a todos por la verdad. Todos los amamos. Los amamos por la verdad. | La verdad vive en nosotros. Estará con nosotros para siempre. | La gracia, la misericordia y la paz vienen de Dios el Padre y de Jesucristo, el Hijo del Padre. Estarán con nosotros en verdad y amor. | Me ha dado mucha alegría encontrar a algunos de tus hijos viviendo según la verdad. Eso es exactamente lo que el Padre nos mandó hacer. | Querida señora, no te estoy escribiendo un nuevo mandamiento. Te estoy escribiendo un mandamiento que hemos tenido desde el principio. Te pido que nos amemos unos a otros. | La manera en que mostramos nuestro amor es obedeciendo los mandamientos de Dios. Él te mandó llevar una vida de amor. Eso es lo que has escuchado desde el principio. | Digo esto porque muchas personas que intentan engañar a otros han salido al mundo. No están de acuerdo en que Jesucristo vino en un cuerpo humano. Personas así intentan engañar a otros. Son enemigos de Cristo. | Ten cuidado de no perder lo que hemos trabajado. Asegúrate de recibir tu recompensa completa. | Supongamos que alguien piensa que sabe más que nosotros. Y supongamos que no está de acuerdo con lo que enseña Cristo. Entonces no pertenecen a Dios. Pero quien se mantiene fiel a lo que enseña Cristo pertenece tanto al Padre como al Hijo. | Supongamos que alguien viene a ti y no enseña estas verdades. Entonces no los recibas en tu casa. No los recibas con agrado. | Cualquiera que los reciba comparte en su obra malvada. | Tengo mucho que escribirte. Pero no quiero usar papel y tinta. En cambio, espero poder visitarte. Entonces podré hablar contigo cara a cara. Eso completará nuestra alegría. | Los hijos de tu hermana elegida envían sus saludos.",
