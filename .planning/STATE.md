## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- **ESM + CJS coexistence:** Package type set to "module" for ESM server.js; Sequelize CLI config uses .cjs extension
- **React Compiler:** Enabled at top-level `reactCompiler` (not experimental) in Next.js 16 with babel-plugin-react-compiler
- **MySQL connection:** Via TCP 127.0.0.1 (not socket) for XAMPP MariaDB compatibility
- **Old Code exclusion:** Added to tsconfig.json exclude and .gitignore

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 (Foundation) Critical Items:**
- Password hash format compatibility ($2y$ to $2b$ bcrypt conversion) must be tested with actual production SQL dump during migration script development
- External PHP API dependency at kindredsplendorapi.com for daily content needs caching fallback pattern established
- Web Push on iOS Safari requires PWA installation (added to home screen) — need to validate UX and provide fallback notification strategy
- XAMPP MySQL root password is set (not empty) — stored in .env.local; future plans should use .env.local values

**Phase 2 (Core Social) Pre-work:**
- Content moderation tooling approach needs decision during planning (custom report/flag system vs third-party API like OpenAI Moderation)

**Phase 5 (Workshops) Planning Dependency:**
- Agora free tier limit (10K minutes/month) may need validation against expected workshop usage before phase planning
