# Out of Scope — Free Luma Platform

**Created:** 2026-02-11
**Purpose:** Quick reference for excluded features. Prevents scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Shop / E-commerce | Not part of Free Luma's core value; adds payment processing, inventory, shipping complexity |
| Redeem codes / physical products | ZOX-specific feature; Free Luma is digital-only |
| User-created groups (ZOX-style) | Free Luma uses admin-defined categories instead; simpler moderation |
| Mobile native app (iOS/Android) | Web-first with responsive design; native deferred until web proves PMF |
| OAuth/SSO (Google, Facebook) | Email/password sufficient for v1; OAuth adds external dependencies |
| Video calls outside workshops | Workshop-only video keeps scope contained |
| Algorithmic "For You" feed | Faith communities value intentional connection; chronological feed aligns better |
| Public vanity metrics | Follower/like counts visible only to profile owner (avoids comparison culture) |
| Open creator registration | Invite/application-based to protect content quality |
| Anonymous posting | Creates moderation nightmares; faith community requires accountability |
| Donation / tithing / payments | Fintech regulatory complexity; partner with existing giving platforms instead |
| Full church management suite | Massive scope creep; competing with established platforms (Faithlife, Planning Center) |
| AI-generated daily content | Faith communities value human authenticity; reputational risk |
| Marketplace (books, courses, merch) | Turns community into storefront; creates pay-to-play dynamics |
| Video editing tools | Out of core competency; users edit externally before upload |
| Advanced analytics for regular users | Creator/host dashboard deferred to v2; regular users don't need detailed analytics |
